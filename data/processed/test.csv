"""and making it easier to hire and fire workers"" This is the type ideological blather the makes people hate economists. Making it easier to fire people reduces wages and in the short term may lead to higher growth by stimulating investment. But then in a decade or so the consumer base you use to have run out of savings, are loaded up with debt and are systematically replaced with a new generation of workers who are paid less, have fewer benefits and less disposable income. Demand start to slip, investment opportunities in the real economy dry up and the next thing you know you have Apple sitting on a mountain of cash because they have run out of consumers who can afford their products and they can make more money out of financial speculation than trying to create profitable products that are cheap enough for an impoverished proletariat. Continuously narrowing your consumer base and expecting long term stability is just plain dumb.

Happens to me all the time. Some walker without even looking just ambles off the sidewalk, his back to me, right in front of my path. Also when traffic turns through a bike lane this involves extra lights and a real cluster mix situation for everyone. And don't get me started about trucks parking in cycle lanes to unload - all the time. And lastly, the worst is car drivers get to shout ""get in the bike lane"" now when I""m going around a truck or something. Bloomberg's ideas have little to do with reality, he's green the way most billionaires are green. One other thing, those electric bikes, they are a true menace.

What I do know however, is that other countries, with lesser wealth than the USA, all have high speed rail, up and running and have for decades now.! Yes,stop corporate welfare, to the likes of Exxon, which runs to a few billion dollars annually and the conglomerate agribusiness hand outs, that are welfare, no matter how you look at it.!

"Dred Scott vs Sanford. I should probably end right there. But, yes to the question, I would still be ashamed--the (unjust) revisings of Law by the Justice's (or appellate judge's) command today are neither few nor small nor non-horrible. And don't forget that the guilded age was created, aided, and abetted by the similarly high-handed Lochner Court, damaging society by, say, effectively criminalizing unions (and letting employers enforce that by not-rare murders of any organizers) and many other things, for, what 40 years or so? Until the most powerful president thus far in history FDR forced them to change course just so he could stop them blocking his efforts to fight the Great Depression? And now we are told, in rulings that are nonsense when compared with the text of the 1st amendment they purportedly derive from, that 'money is speech', along with the power of rich and business over politicians? Oh--right, I was supposed to leave that one out. I would be ashamed. Dred Scott.",supreme court,0

"#12 elizabeth: Right on about the continued importance of French! French is spoken as a native or near-native language by something like 200 million people (most of whom are not French). If you add a few hundred million more non-native speakers and consider the global distribution of places where French is important to commerce and politics, it is obviously one of the most widely spoken and influential languages in the world - and the numbers are growing, not falling. French-speaking Africa is experiencing some of the highest rates of population growth in the world, and incidentally contains a large chunk of the world's untapped supplies of oil, uranium, and other natural resources. Meanwhile, France is the only major European power whose population is actually growing, and is on track to become Western Europe's most populous country in just a few decades; so the future of French as a pan-European language also looks bright. So yes, French is a heavy hitter as global languages go. In some parts of the world, it is indispensable for diplomacy and business. So maybe - just maybe - it would be a good idea for our universities to keep teaching it.",colleges,1

"Professor Nussbaum speaks a vital truth. We have a constant push for more science and mathematics, more technology majors. The assumption is that we are losing the international sweepstakes if we don't excel other nations in these fields. We want to make the Faustian bargain, in which we choose to gain the whole world, technical ascendancy, by forfeiting our soul, the humanities.

The greedy gutless wonders in the GOP who want to dismantle a system that works (Medicare) rather than to continually improve on it are the slithering heels who are not subject to any of the ill will they recklessly want to inflict on the nation. They go merrily along with salary and pensions they have not even come close to earning and lifelong medical care. So why should they care? Congress should be required to live in and depend on the realities they wish to impose on Americans.,medicare,1
"Memories are SHORT. The reason for Medicare in the first place was because seniors could not afford to pay insurance. As we get older, we have more health problems. I'm 77 ... had breast cancer 3 times. Try paying for that! Then, last year I broke my right femur in a fall. No way I could have paid for that. Insurance has to charge more for seniors period. Many seniors only have social security for support. $1348.00 a month does not buy much. We must keep Medicare as we know it.",medicare,1

In a chaotic world, getting more chaotic all the time, children need continuity and structure to focus on learning and some sense of security that the people who care about them will be there. Schools......aren't.......businesses........at least, they shouldn't be. If a school were run the way all the deformers would have it, there would be a revolving door of teachers in and out every 2 - 3 years, based on who is getting the polished apples or not.

"I found Professor Brennan's view elitist and arrogant. He has been fortunate enough to have had an education and now sits in judgement on those whom he perceives as to stupid to vote, and as he politely intimates would spoil his nice little educated democracy. Mandatory voting does not mean you actually have to vote, it just means you have to attend the polling booth on election day. As Eric Walk (17) mentioned many citizens have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that you have that privilege, is it too much to ask that those enjoying the benefits of that sacrifice show their respect on election day by participating in what is and has been fought and died for, regardless of your level of formal education. Would Professor Brennan suggest that those in the armed services are also of a similar level of intelligence? Or is it alright that those who belong to the lowest socioeconomic group in the US continue to do the lion's share of the fighting and dying for his right to vote as has been the case since the Vietnam War.",voting,1
"To legalize doping/medical alterations is, in a way, forcing all athletes to partake. If, as an athlete, I don't want to take drugs or genetically mutate my body to improve performance, I may as well not even show up. The assumption is made that if it is allowed everyone will participate...which is not necessarily the case. Not to mention that by allowing corporate sponsorship, we create an uneven playing field with the rich vs. poor countries.

"The problem is that economic expertise is primarily used by politicians in only convenient, self-serving ways. As someone who majored in economics as an undergraduate at a top liberal arts college, I have found that I can easily discern principled use of economic science from self-serving use. I can also say that over the last 20 years, the impact of macro-economic policy, both fiscal and monetary, has NEVER surprised me. It's also clear to me that many things in this world are primarily driven by things outside the realm of economics. It saddens me that so many professional economists are willing to rent out their professional reputation so cheaply, and to debase the profession so casually. I can't blame the public for dismissing economists generally, but I can lament that the ability to make the world a better place is so casually and needlessly wasted by political opportunists.",economists,0

"Prof. Cohen is absolutely right. Economic theory has trumped economic reality for many generations. I would add that economists do not only fail to account for irrational passions--those ""animal spirits"" that Keynes described--but for the weight of history upon those passions. For instance, economists are mystified that personal savings rate remain so high, even six years into this supposed recovery. This is not a mystery: people remember history. Sixty-five months ago, their investments evaporated. Edmund Burke--yes that Edmund Burke--realized this 225 years ago when he claimed that ""the age of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded."" What they had succeeded in overcoming was, in part, peoples' sense of history.",economists,0

I like it the way it is now. Just like Social Security it was not meant for all. The system doesn't have the resources to expand it's coverage. The reason we have Medicare is to care of the elderly People pay into the system for the benefits the government will give them in the future. It won't be able to do that if the number of people getting benefits isn't fewer than the people who pay into the system. This is how some get more benefits than they put in. It's because some will get nothing. That is why it won't work if you make this benefit available to others.,medicare,1

For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico. I don;t suppose defending that border will be as costly as NATO has been. It should leave funds left over for fixing our many neglected internal problems,nato,0

"Blue collar jobs: My plumber and electrician are both smart guys and seem to do well financially. My hairdresser has somehow amassed enough money to buy and sell large pieces of real estate. I know a young man who makes plenty in his window-washing business, and another friend, who works on computers with a technical-school education, has a house bigger than mine (I have a PhD). A couple of decades ago, we had an addition built on our house, and we used a highly recommended contractor. He told us that, when he graduated from high school, he took the money his father had saved for his college and started a business instead. He is still in business, probably has not had time for college. He has been successful and does good work. I would never minimize the importance of college for those who have a reason to go, but I can't agree with the one-size-fits-all philosophy.

"Mr. Adams, in the absence of regulations, there would be no financial fallout. As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout.

Beyond that, when, in many elections, less than 20% of the registered voters bother to show up in the first place, it would seem that we as voters suppress ourselves far more effectively than any voter ID laws.",free photo ids,1

"It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students. Schools are places of employment for teachers to educate students. Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed. With unemployment still high, and the number of students graduating college increasing, I see no logical reason that it will make staffing schools any harder than it already has been. Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments. The same protections that protect other workers will protect teachers. They really don't need special treatment just because it might hurt morale. Let the experiment run its course.

I am appalled at the apologia for obesity expressed here. The idea that people who eat themselves into poor health should be some sort of protected class of Americans blows my mind. Government should only be used to protect people who are suffering through no fault of their own, not as a crutch for people who have abandoned any sense of personal responsibility. I hope liberals and progressives can wake up and realize that when you pass laws that protect such irresponsibility, you undermine any effort to restrain the real villains, like the corporate crooks that control America.",legislation,0

Perhaps I'm wrong but I know of no such instance even during the most divisive period of American life, the Civil War.

Nor did Marshall rip into Jefferson though he despised him and said so many times -- privately, that is. What Ginsburg did was disgraceful. I despise Trump and view his election as a potential disaster. But Justices like serving members of the military should remain silent and not enter the political fray. Would those who support Ginsburg's public comments about Trump also support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff coming out in favor of his election? I strongly doubt it.

"I would assume that the only group opposed to our leaving NATO are those element of the military industrial complex that profit financially from our continued participation. Beyond the savings in dollars, there are two significant advantages in doing so. First, it would trend against the reality of empires falling as a result of overextending themselves militarily, and second, it would go a long way toward bringing Russia back into the community of European nations, ending a major source of Russian paranoia. Unfortunately, this move makes so much sense that it is unlikely the present congress would entertain it.",nato,0

"Whoever sees room for debate here is just shoveling sand into the growing tide of public revulsion against doping in sports. And the public is right. When the doors open to performance enhancement drugs, they close for the person who does not wish to take drugs in order to compete. I'm not sure exactly who benefits from that outcome, but it's definitely not your kid swinging at softballs in the backyard this summer. Why call it sport if it's to become just a contest to see who can round up the best set of drugs plus the most short-term-minded, health-reckless contestants, coaches, doctors and parents? There was a time when sports competition was about sport. Against great odds today, it still is that for some competitors. They give their best effort and accept either defeat or triumph as just a part of every game, not its only measure. Those competitors are worthy of being our kids' sports hereoes. Who are they now? It's sad that we have to wonder. It's even sadder to contemplate a sports world in which all the winners are on drugs.",doping,0

"Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus. Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day.",fraternities and sororities,0
"There are two major points that bother me about the possibility of players legally doping themselves. The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other). Would games become even more a show of force between the haves and the have nots?",doping,0

Mandatory voting would make matters worse. Most of those not voting are making a wise decision since most are not well informed on the issues. Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now. These media buys are financed by special interest groups whose interests generally do not serve the nation as a whole. The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess. We need to start with real campaign finance reform that not only restricts how much can be given but also how much can be spent. It requires a constitutional amendment so it will be difficult. It can still happen if the public becomes aware of how bad the situation is and that a real solution is available. This is not a left or right issue. It is one that goes to core values of all Americans.,voting,0

"NATO's decline is irreversible. It serves no European defence needs at all. From time to time it may involve itself in some US Imperial adventure. Or provide cover for some latter day petty European Imperial foray into Africa. There is no Russian threat at all. And no prospect of using NATO as a backstop in the US pivot to confront the inexorable rise of China. Indeed for Europe there is no Chinese threat unless Russia joins a Chinese axis. And in this case NATO is unlikely to be an adequate tool for the brave new world. such an alliance would portend. NATO serves the interests of the US regime and consequently they must bear the financial costs. If the US government doesn't want to pay the bill let it leave. What keeps the US paying is not some positive commitment to democracy,human rights or the American way it is (and quite obviously) fear.

"There were a few times in our history when tuition was waved. After WWII there was the GI Bill. Another was the Russian successful launch of the Sputnik. Both opened university doors to millions of students. I was one of them. With that assistance I made my way into medicine. Others became engineers or researchers. What I know is the nation got a boost of talent, and brought progress to the nation. Mr. Petrilli describes the effect of poverty, and negates the possibility of many to advance themselves and this country. Education even if paid by tax payers does not address every short fall in society, but it does help many. It is time to reject fatalist opinion, and redirect our attention to doing what should be done to improve everyone's survival.",college,1
"Those who ascribe to a mythology-based belief system are well-known through history for the demonizing and murder of everyone else not like them. Christians have 2000 years of experience in the killing of Jews and others, and LGBT folks are only a more recent target because they have been harder to recognize in years past. Organized religions are gigantic hypocrisy machines, pointing to ancient texts to explain how kind they are while running pogroms and burning heretics at the stake most of the time. Our society should step away from the taxpayer-funded support of those whose sacred texts read like comic books with fairies, supermen and flying horses. The Lord Aquaman will be ok with that, since he is all merciful.",christians,0

I see the elimination of foreign language classes as one more sign of the dumbing-down of America. C'est dommage.",humanities programs,1
"""Medicare enrollees would have nothing to fear from insurers charging actuarially fair premiums, because the size of their check would depend on their health status and income, so lower-income and sicker enrollees would get bigger ""Medicare checks"" than healthy and wealthy enrollees..."" Exactly how is this going to be administered? So I start the year healthy and then get sick. Is there a mid-year correction? Would my subsidy go to insurance or directly to pay for care? Who is going to handle the extra layer of paperwork? As for the waste, most enrollees have no control over the wasted spending, and they often have no idea that it's wasteful. For instance, Medicare spends over $300 million on pre-op tests for eye surgery, when research shows those tests don't contribute to positive outcomes. Even when you show a hospital the research they refuse to budge. I've had to fight off unnecessary care many times. I would love for Medicare to make it easier to say no.",medicare,1

"Gaps in European military spending for what threat? Terrorism, by and large, is a law enforcement and intelligence agency problem. It's been used by those who didn't know what to focus on after the end of the cold war as an excuse to continue to play the same old games they were familiar with from the cold war. The USA can no longer afford to p,at the role of world policeman, and Europe - which faces no credible threat of military invasion-can and should provide for its own military needs. The cold war mentality got the USA into too many problems it should never have gotten into - Korea, Vietnam, desert storm, and the two Bush wars. We should disband NATO and while we are at it ask ourselves why are we defending south Korea and Japan? Like Europe these are two rich nations that could defend themselves. Besides the endless waste of money, would anyone reading this think the lives of their son or daughter is worth defending south Korea? It's not 1950 anymore.

In addition, we charge these students 6% to 8% interest!!! Sometimes they have children entering college on credit before they get their student loans paid off. Ridiculous.

Free tuition will only increase college enrollments if we prepare the students for college. The tuition free education is great but we have to start preparing the students early. This way they will strive for the free education. Low income families want the best for their children and this is a way to give the minority students the same chances as other students. I believe that the community colleges are great for students and the funding if made available will allow our students to complete a 2 year degree and more forward with the motivation to get that 4 year degree. We are trying this method with our children in 2016. The federal and state governments must invest in our institutions where the majority of our students are attending.,college,1

"I would offer the experience of my alma mater, Amherst College. When I was at Amherst (Class of 1961), the school was all male and had fraternities (I was a member of Chi Phi). When the college went coed, it required the fraternities to go coed as well. That did not go well at all, and the result was that Amherst abolished all fraternities. A better choice would have been to add sororities to campus life.",fraternities and sororities,1

As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done . Just like mandatory seat belts in all US states the same could be argued for mandatory substance abuse treatment,drug addicts,1

"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.",supreme court,0

"It's strange that Christians can read the Bible and not see how many times the concept of ""marriage"" has changed. Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah ""marry"" other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife.

Second, both can be rather unreliable, however, on average the predictions are better than random chance. For example, knowing when when to plant crops and when NOT to plant makes agriculture vastly more effective. If you plant before the river floods or before the last hard frost you're in big trouble. Ancient peoples spent a good bit of money trying to get that right. It was money well spent, even though it wasn't particularly accurate. It was good enough.",economists,1

This fact, hated by progressives, is the key. It never involves everyone with that right taking advantage of it.",conceal carry of firearms,1

"Christian churches long ago strayed from the gospel message of love and mercy and focused on certain sexual acts. Pope Francis recently called the Catholic church on its obsession with abortion, same-sex marriage and birth control. Such obsessions are narrow and negative and tend to miss Christ's main message: to treat persons as persons, not use them as objects. IMHO this means we should be more concerned about one person using or abusing another than about what two consenting adults do to express their love for each other.",christians,0

Medicare is excellent insurance and doesn't need to be changed into a voucher Program. No insurance company wants to sell insurance to a 90 year old man with a 'Coupon'.

"Obese people live difficult lives to be sure, but pointing the finger at genetics or saying they are discriminated against is simply avoiding the ugly truth. They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame? Same for someone who has an addictive personality who turns to illicit drugs or alcohol. In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors. Anyone can lose weight - even lying still in bed. So, the real question isn't about discrimination, it's about leveling the playing field. If you have an addiction, any addiction, you should be treated equally in the workplace.",legislation,1

Everyone knows that teachers are slackers who are too lazy to find real jobs and receive taxpayer money for jobs which they systematically fail to perform. How many teachers actually work before their first classes and after the end of their last classes? The end to all of that, now. It's one thing to complain about real problems with significant effects upon what affects the K-12 educations, it's quite another make up problems which don't. Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation. The performance of students at the end of K-12 corresponds to the affluence and support of education in the community. There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities. Administrators who focus their frustrations upon low performing teachers while fearing to challenge under supporting communities are going to end up just as frustrated as they are today. These districts will get better teachers by tapping a lot more money from taxpayers and not by any other method.",tenure,0

Anyone can who pays the money will have the knowledge and skills injected into their minds, and thus benefit. So why should some be handed it while others pay for it? One must perform considerable work over a prolonged period of time and not everyone has the ability to do it in a reasonable time nor to be able to use it well. But the reason society creates and maintains colleges and universities is that they enable all to benefit from the knowledge and skills those able and willing to gain them do for themselves and everybody else.

"'You must vote,"" I often hear, ""because the next president will pick who sits on the Supreme Court!"" That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. ""living Constitution"", ""originalism"", ""texturalism""; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not ""umpires"", to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are ""umpires"" each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game.",supreme court,1

Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators to fire bad teachers where there's actually a reason to do so.

It could have a marker on it to show if we are citizens, non-citizens here legally, or non-citizens here for only a period of time.

"Citizens should absolutely be able to record police activity if they're not obstructing officers from lawful action, and this right should be explicitly codified. The trouble is, many police officers who either don't understand that right or don't want to be videotaped have a way of halting the taping then coming up with reasons why they were justified in doing so -- claiming obstruction or other bad behavior from the citizen, etc. Then the tape comes back empty and you end up with a he-said she-said mess of what actually happened. The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty.

That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama. First of all, a society that claims to be free CANNOT force people to vote. It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win! And finally, this is one of the stupidest, most over-reaching, totalitarian ideas since Obamacare mandating that people who do not want to pay for insurance should be forced to get it anyway.

Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life.

The christianity I'm familiar with (aside from progressive catholic school) and have deep experience with is overwhelmingly anti-gay.

She said she knows what the bible says and so she can judge. Complete hatred from (evangelical fundamentalist) christians toward gays is mainly what I know. I have no doubt several of my relatives were wondering why more gays weren't killed in Orlando as I've heard those comments before. They're not keen on non-christian's either.

The author is concerned about maintaining the judiciary's ""umpire"" role, but the legitimacy of our government is being jeopardized.

Her frank acknowledgment of her own mortality and that of her fellow Justices is almost a sad metaphor for the rule of law in this country should Trump come to power (i.e., its days are numbered). Giving Trump the power to appoint even 1 Justice would, in the ""best"" case scenario, reignite the GOP's shameless attempts to undermine every right that doesn't involve a church, a gun or a corporation. Now consider that he might be empowered to appoint 2 (3?) during his time in office. What good would Ginsburg's silence have been while she watches generations of jurisprudence perverted by a smirking fascist? Is she to console herself with the thought that ""well, it wasn't my place to say""? If she is technically allowed to speak up, we should thanks our stars that she is inclined to do so.",elections,0

"I believe too much emphasis is being place on voter turnout, and not enough emphasis is being placed on education. Is a low unemployment rate a good thing? Yes. Is a high rate of education a good thing? Yes. Is a high voter turnout a good thing? Well, quite frankly that depends. Why is it high? Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator. It simply tells you what question you need to ask next. Because what we want is not a high voter turnout. What we want is a large majority of Americans making their opinions heard. While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus. If we succeed in better educating the American people, voter turnout should naturally go up, providing a good indicator of how well we are doing.",voting,1
"I'm a native New Yorker who, in years past, never would have biked in the city because of fear for my safety. However, because of the new bike lanes, I now feel safe enough to bike around my neighborhood in Brooklyn. This summer, I bought a bike for the first time. Yesterday -- December 21 -- I biked 13 miles to visit my parents in Manhattan, riding 75% of the way on bike lanes. The assertions that (a) the bike lanes don't help move people from cars and public transit to bikes, (b) bikers stop using the lanes in the colder months, and (c) bikers prefer non-bike-laned streets are all false in my case.

"I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for).

"More regulation and government intervention rather than less is definitely the answer. Any privatization, block grant or cash payment scheme will directly result in tens of millions of seniors well beyond working age becoming unable to afford medical care. It would strip the security of medical coverage from the most vulnerable among us, the aged. It will also burden their children with additional costs, born of of guilt. This will all result in nothing less than economic stagnation spanning generations. This country's wealthiest individuals are by far the richest and least taxed in our two hundred year history. These plutocrats who have enriched themselves on the backs of working men and women can afford to pay in more and take out less. America's economic security and social justice both equally depend on it.",medicare,1

Justices have free speech but it not part of their job to say political views when their primary job is to enforce the law as it is written or nullify a law which in its time may have been just but it is not now. THATS IT!

"Dr. DuPont and the three other debaters conveniently overlook an important part of the current epidemic of prescription opioid abuse: we really know very little about it. As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential. Do any of the debaters recommend forcing these patients into treatment for this problem?

"Herein lies the rub ...""Many require remedial courses to catch up to college-level work."" What are we doing wrong in K-12 to prepare students for the rigors of college? Heck, my daughter has well above a 4.0 and has scored high on PSAT, etc and I still worry about the rigors of college. We need to set up all students for success. If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life. It's also not the only way. Yes, there are plenty of students attending college on their parents' dime who don't make it and while that wouldn't fly with me, it's their money, not mine. I feel differently about it when taxpayers are funding it.",college,1

In the absence of job protection, it is very easy to imagine states and districts where a teacher would be fired for teaching evolution, for not teaching creationism, for political activities outside of school, for putting Huckleberry Finn on the syllabus, etc. As for the judge's statement that it takes a decade and hundreds of thousands of dollars to fire a bad teacher, that may be because of a particularly onerous set of state laws in California, but that alone doesn't make tenure as a general principle wrong.

A foolish assumption ignoring decades of reality. Turning Medicare into a voucher program and letting people ""shop"" puts all the financial burden onto the backs of people who can least afford it. Healthcare costs will continue to rise until a ""pay for quality and results"" model gets fully implemented. Without that these vouchers will never be allowed to grow in value equal to the healthcare inflation rate. So they will become less valuable and the poor and seniors will suffer. In an ACA-type model, or better yet, a single payer model, implemented with a solid ""pay for performance"" component, the government shoulders the burden of increasing healthcare costs, not the poorest and most vulnerable, and the government takes the responsibility of driving pricing reform because individual consumers cannot do this.",medicare,0

Trump exploits their ignorance, and thus their fears, masterfully. ""I have the answers, and its their fault, not yours (always someone else).

"I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours. As I found out, when you make a profession out of the humanities, it leads to crass careerism and outlandish theory.",humanities programs,2

"I believe that the right to vote is sufficiently enumerated without having to go through the amendment process. Instead of another amendment, we need elected officials who take seriously their obligation to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies - including those who would disenfranchise millions of American citizens. We need judges who clearly understand that a requirement to present one's driver's license at the polls violates the 24th amendment, as the driver's license fee is a tax. We need to rise up against efforts to disenfranchise college students through various technicalities in residency requirements as violations of the equal protection clause. Here in North Carolina, the NAACP, led by Rev. William Barber, rose up against the draconian voter suppression laws in the Moral Monday movement that swept our state.

The artificialities of recording and broadcast media get in the way, and the rush to the bottom in recorded quality to eliminate dynamic range proves that being able to hear any music on demand has reduced it to background, serving only to cover up the increasing noise of the world and paint over the isolation of the Information Age.

"So often organized religion is morally bankrupt, trailing the enlightenment of the secular. When it was slavery, all the major protestant denominations split at the Mason Dixon line, with half embracing the cause of slavery. After the civil war they all embraced Jim Crow segregation. They finally come around long after everyone with a real conscience has. History now repeats itself on the LGBT issue. Gays and lesbians finally decided they had had enough and courageously proclaimed their right to be who they were, and most of the rest of us, when confronted with this obvious moral imperative, have recognized this societal wrong for what it was, equivalent to racism. Whose left? conservative religions (Islam included). They claim the higher moral ground but are always the last to see their own sin. I have no doubt that in the next twenty years or so, when it will no longer be possible to claim any moral standing or viability, they will, finally, also come around, The last, trailing indicator of a moral evolution, like always.

Thus many of us are trying to live more sustainable lives, which often means turning our backs on suburbia, car culture and over-consumption. Choosing biking, car sharing companies like ZipCar, and living downtown means not only helping the climate and environment but spending less money on a car, which is one of the worst investments a young person can make because of depreciation and expensive car loans. In another part of today's Times, there's an article about predatory lending in the used car loan industry.

"""Barring a drastic improvement in efficiency, tuition-free colleges won't have the resources to serve additional students without compromising the quality of their offerings."" Improvement in efficiency is key here. Certification provides jobs, and social improvement provides purpose. They are different, society benefits when people are working in a rapidly changing job culture. The individual benefits from better communication, cultural growth and personal recognition. Society has an obligation to pay for its own growth - certification for work. ""Despite free tuition, just one-third of students from the bottom income quartile who started at a community college in 2003 finished a degree or certificate by 2009."" What on earth is a bottom income quartile student? These are people who need doable steps. If this interferes with the ability to obtain a self-supporting job, society pays.

He often informed the class that his door was always open and to please stop by for any questions or concerns. He was caring, helpful, and respectful of all students in the class.""

Having worked in the Midwest for the past 5 years amidst a predominantly millennial workforce, I (a now retired baby boomer from New England) was shocked over how many were getting married, having multiple children and committing themselves to a conservative/traditional career path before they reached 30. I particularly noticed that the workforce crowd in the large high rise downtown office buildings in Minneapolis were of the same general age for the most part. There were vey few folks with gray hair such as myself. Perhaps this is just the way the Midwest has always been, but I found it surprising, and a bit disheartening that these folks were already middle aged in my eyes, having committed themselves to a sentence of 30 plus years in office space drudgery without testing the waters of their youth.",young people,2
"""From beginning to end, I believe the Bible is the infallible word of God and I accept it in whole, not in part. As such, I believe the Bible is clear that homosexuality is a sin."" Is it clear? The ancient Israelites inherited a law that homosexual acts (particularly outside of a straight marriage) were sinful, but the rest of the Bible is silent on gay and lesbian people in committed relationships, or possibly it even hints at approval in the story of David and Jonathan. Anti-gay theology is a clear case of the very slicing and dicing that ultra-conservatives claim to abhor. Anyway, a people who accepted the whole Bible would have a lot of child-murder to do. Clearly even ultra-conservative Christians don't take the ancient laws at face value. If they did, then they might be allowed to claim religious liberty as an excuse to preach that gays exist outside of God's plan for humanity. But because they don't, and because the whole Bible is not clear on the subject, this boils down to a belief held by a group of people.

"This write up is enlightening and sensible, dispeling some popular misconception about the breath taking 3D printing technological revolution. Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined. There can little argument that every industry must be fast, flexible and capable to understand the implications that 3D printing will have on their businesses. Failure will mean disaster.

Sixty-five months ago, their investments evaporated.

For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico. I don;t suppose defending that border will be as costly as NATO has been. It should leave funds left over for fixing our many neglected internal problems,nato,2

"It's perhaps not surprising that those advocating the dissolution of humanities programs adopt a vocational view of the utility of language education. According to this view, the sole point of learning a foreign language is to be able to conduct business dealings in that language. If there is no need for French in the workplace, there is no need for French in the college curriculum. This attitude of course misses innumerable advantages of learning a foreign language, and shokcinlgy enough, even a dead language like Latin. Reading directly in another language without the filter of translation, engaging with another culture and another mode of seeing and thinking about the world, and learning how to express oneself in another tongue - all of these things have no meaning to the utilitarians and the philistines. I suppose if everyone else just spoke English we could dispense with all this nonsense about foreign languages. And by the way, it's not just French that's being extirpated at SUNY Albany - it's Italian, Russian, classics and theater, too. But that's ok, none of that has anything to do with conducting business.",colleges,2

As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout. They would build diesel cars that maximized their profit and that imposed tremendous costs on everyone else. There would be no incentive whatsoever for them to do anything else.",auto regulations,2

"It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students. Schools are places of employment for teachers to educate students. Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed. With unemployment still high, and the number of students graduating college increasing, I see no logical reason that it will make staffing schools any harder than it already has been. Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments. The same protections that protect other workers will protect teachers. They really don't need special treatment just because it might hurt morale. Let the experiment run its course. If it doesn't work, then we will course correct.",tenure,2

She made a conscious choice to attend, and it is worth saying that at the time she matriculated at Wellesley, other schools did admit women - Penn, Cornell, Brown, Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, University of Chicago, just to name a few. ""There is no data to support the myth that ... graduates [of single-sex colleges] are more likely to choose math-intensive career options."" Where are the non-data that support this assertion? I was under the impression that the students at women's colleges major in STEM fields at rates markedly higher than women on coed campuses.

I am appalled at the apologia for obesity expressed here. The idea that people who eat themselves into poor health should be some sort of protected class of Americans blows my mind. Government should only be used to protect people who are suffering through no fault of their own, not as a crutch for people who have abandoned any sense of personal responsibility.

"Has a Supreme Court Justice in the entire history of the United States ever publicly criticized a presidential candidate? Perhaps I'm wrong but I know of no such instance even during the most divisive period of American life, the Civil War. Justice Taney, for example, never publicly took Lincoln to task, though Lincoln often eviscerated his Dred Scott decision. Nor did Marshall rip into Jefferson though he despised him and said so many times -- privately, that is. What Ginsburg did was disgraceful. I despise Trump and view his election as a potential disaster. But Justices like serving members of the military should remain silent and not enter the political fray. Would those who support Ginsburg's public comments about Trump also support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff coming out in favor of his election? I strongly doubt it. Indeed, they would probably demand his scalp and they would be right to do so.",ginsburg,2

"Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus. Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day.",fraternities and sororities,2

Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now.

For instance, Medicare spends over $300 million on pre-op tests for eye surgery, when research shows those tests don't contribute to positive outcomes. Even when you show a hospital the research they refuse to budge. I've had to fight off unnecessary care many times. I would love for Medicare to make it easier to say no.",medicare,2

I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done .

"There has to be a forum in which a final decision is made when the legislative and executive branches cannot agree, or where laws passed by the states or federal government run contrary to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and/or current norms (such as gay marriage). Hence, the Supreme Court. Complain all you want, it's a system that has worked pretty well. The notable recent failures were the appointment of GW Bush as President and recent and repeated failures of civil rights for African Americans. Our alternative might be a monarchy, gridlock beyond what we already have, or governments that fail and fall repeatedly as in Italy or Greece or (fill in name here).",supreme court,2
"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.",justice term limits,2

There are legal protections and remedies that all employees have against prejudicial firing.

The minute number of teachers actually fired for cause speaks for itself. Additionally the argument that reducing tenure will hurt morale might be true for the bad teachers who jobs are at risk.

"It's strange that Christians can read the Bible and not see how many times the concept of ""marriage"" has changed. Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah ""marry"" other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife. Mosaic law allowed men to obtain divorces from their wives and remarry, but Jesus (who supposedly did not change one ""jot or tittle"" of the law) said that this was adultery in most cases. Clearly ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable. It seems an odd thing to hold ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" to be fixed and unalterable now when it was not so in the past, and it is needlessly cruel to use this concept as a means of hurting loving, committed same-sex couples.",gay marriage,2

"Some have questioned whether a gun-carrying woman with a gun pressed against her head would have prevailed had she drawn her weapon. We don't know, but it seems doubtful. Many college students love parties, binge drinking and the problems (including anger, fights and sexual abuse) created by those situations. College students also face emotional problems that do or can lead to suicide, and a gun is the easy exit choice -- as it was many years ago when a college freshman friend of mine took his life. Troubled high school and college students are frequently in the news for causing mayhem and carnage on campus. Generally those so inclinded use surprise as a strategy. We don't know the outcomes if other students and teachers packed weapons. Speculation is easy. What outcome if the law required every person over 17 to carry a loaded weapon? Do we really want to find out? At a controversial football game, would someone kill the umpire? Doug Giebel Big Sandy, Montana",gun,2
"The right to vote is already protected in many ways. That said, it is also one of the greatest privileges offered to the American people, and the idea that a privilege should not require some effort to take advantage of has wrongly become embedded in too much commentary in this country. We have freedom of speech, legally protected, but with political correctness rampant in our universities and communities, and people (often from the same disadvantaged groups complaining about voting rights) demonstrating and shouting down any opinions but theirs, I have to say that protection of folks relative to laws is a meaningless protection at best. Indeed, if those folks worried about voting rights took as much time voting and making sure they can as they did demonstrating about it, there would not be a problem with peoples ability to vote at all. And don't even get me started on government overreach at being big brother that makes us afraid to say anything in public, out loud, or online. So much for free speech!

People also used to have as many kids as they could because so many died in childhood, modern medicine has put an end to the need for that.

"Obese people live difficult lives to be sure, but pointing the finger at genetics or saying they are discriminated against is simply avoiding the ugly truth. They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame? Same for someone who has an addictive personality who turns to illicit drugs or alcohol. In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors. Anyone can lose weight - even lying still in bed. So, the real question isn't about discrimination, it's about leveling the playing field.

Little did they know that over the course of 10 years - 1935-45, that their Jewish heritage would condemn them and their families, including children to genocide orchestrated by the man they thought would not be able to sway the German people to succeed as Chancellor of Germany. They were wrong. I think Justice Ginsburg has more historic perspective than we care to admit. I don't think, as others have confirmed, that being a Judge precludes one from abdicating one's right to vote and free speech on the candidates that stand for election. Further, if Justice Ginsburg is involved in a case that may present a conflict she would be expected to recuse herself.

If some business guy in LA is telling me that this band is so good that it cost $200 to hear them play, or that this band is the next best thing to rocket to number one, it ain't rock and roll.

"Making teachers more vulnerable to termination is bound to cause them to begin to actually try to teach. Everyone knows that teachers are slackers who are too lazy to find real jobs and receive taxpayer money for jobs which they systematically fail to perform. How many teachers actually work before their first classes and after the end of their last classes? The end to all of that, now. It's one thing to complain about real problems with significant effects upon what affects the K-12 educations, it's quite another make up problems which don't. Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation. The performance of students at the end of K-12 corresponds to the affluence and support of education in the community. There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities. Administrators who focus their frustrations upon low performing teachers while fearing to challenge under supporting communities are going to end up just as frustrated as they are today. These districts will get better teachers by tapping a lot more money from taxpayers and not by any other method.",tenure,2

The study of French is the doorway to understanding our own background (some 40% of English derives from French), our history, our identity. Cutting such vital elements of education is in fact suicidal for U.S. society.",humanities programs,2
"I am a physics professor at a liber I was tenured as a physics professor at a private liberal arts university about 30 years ago. Over the course of the last 15 years, new hires in physics ( and mathematics too) have been in applied, multidisciplinary fields. Unfortunately, the intellectual challenges presented to research workers in most of these areas are rather minimal. Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire. The loss of French departments and other humanities departments is just part of the reorganized modern university, which is an instrument of the modern nation state to attain greater wealth and power for some and a stultifying life for most. Where does this madness end?",humanity,2

"'You must vote,"" I often hear, ""because the next president will pick who sits on the Supreme Court!"" That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. ""living Constitution"", ""originalism"", ""texturalism""; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not ""umpires"", to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are ""umpires"" each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game.",supreme court,2

Back in reality, tenure is basically a rule that allows the firing of bad teachers while prohibiting the firing of good ones. Like any rule implemented by human beings, it can be derailed by incompetent supervisors, but the rule itself doesn't protect bad teachers. It protects good ones. Ending tenure doesn't make it any easier for a competent administrator to fire a bad teacher, but it DOES make it easier for an incompetent administrator to fire a GOOD teacher.

It is about a segment of radical Christian fundamentalists that are vigorous in promoting a worldview that is based on a literal reading of some sentences in the Old Testament and are resistant to accepting cultural change and living in a secular society. I am understanding of their dismay and anger - after all, America has become a society where individualism, commercialism, materialism and transnational capitalism have triumphed over community, charity, spirituality and democratic socialism. They feel that they are under attack, just as men did when women received the vote and as whites did in the 1960s who had to live with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights act, which empowered minorities. Radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Muslim population, just a radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Christian population.

"I would be in favor of the following. At least one of the two chambers (presumably the Senate) should ONLY have voters who have graduated from college. Right now, we talk about everyone voting, as if it was some kind of religious ritual like the Sabbath or Ramadhan. But voting is not a religious ritual, it is participation in government making. And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates. We complain that they are appealing to ignorant voters, and at the same time we insist that more of the ignorant vote. This is foolish.

Seems to me that national security demands the study of foreign languages. Or shall we not bother gathering information on the Russians? How many nations in the world speak French? How many are in Asia and Africa, where business opportunities abound, as do the national security concerns Just travel to these nations to learn?

Legally, it's not so clear because our Constitution guarantees freedom of religion while our statutes and the common law set some limits upon how individuals can treat their children when the outcomes imperil their lives and welfare. As a result even if the parents opt out of health care insurance because they do not seek any health care, if they or their children need emergency care it will be provided unless they can legally refuse treatment -- meaning that the children will likely receive health care when the conditions are serious enough regardless of the parents wishes.",religion,2
"Wrong, America does not have serious voter turnout problems. Democrats have serious voter turnout problems. Of course they would support mandating that people ignorant of the issues vote. That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama. First of all, a society that claims to be free CANNOT force people to vote. It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win! And finally, this is one of the stupidest, most over-reaching, totalitarian ideas since Obamacare mandating that people who do not want to pay for insurance should be forced to get it anyway.

Why in the world should he be required by law to incur higher medical bills and lost days at work because I decide to stuff my face with pizza or ice cream? It makes no sense any more than it makes sense for people be required by law to pay the health costs for people who acquire a disease because of their voluntary participation in unprotected sex activities or ride motorcycles without helmets or smoke cigarettes. An illness or incapacity acquired like my obesity should not be thrust upon those who are struggling to make ends meet.",refusal to hire because of weight,2

Also, only the wealthy pay the 'rack rate' full tuition at the top institutions with decent endowments or state funding. Free tuition would increase two things: more marginally or unqualified applicants and proliferation of easy, feel good, study yourself courses and majors. The idea of substituting community service for standardized test scores and grades as a basis for admission will further dilute the seriousness of university scholarship.

While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus.

When people think they're just fine, but they're beating up their elderly parents (who won't press charges, believing that home is the safest place for their wayward offspring), then they need to be forcibly removed and treated. They may have severe emotional problems, but they're still a menace.

By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere.

"I live about 2 blocks from the University of Utah campus, where concealed carry has been permitted for something like 5 years now, but only for people who meet the usual criteria for such which means only those 21 or over can legally carry. Utah is also a state which is getting used to open carry. I've seen examples of that practice maybe every third month or so. That is also permitted on campus here, but only for concealed carry permit holders. I take walks on that campus and I rarely think about guns being near me because they will be near me pretty much any where I go in Utah. When I go to the 24 hour fitness gym at Trolley Corners about 2 miles away I sometimes do remember the mass shooting that occurred at Trolley Square just across the street about 9 years ago.

"I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms. It is a reality, not merely a sign of increasingly philistine times.",humanities programs,2

If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential.

But, with the assigning of research papers, teachers and professors must ensure that they are teaching the proper critical reading and analytical skills with which to evaluate and utilise these resources. Given the extremely complex world in which we live, the ability to reason critically and vigorously couldn't be stressed enough. Assigning essays and the research paper would enable students to work with seeming volumes of sometimes contrasting information, come to a view, defend that view, and reconcile that view with differing ones - that's what we do everyday, and the ability to do it well is necessary to maintain a free-thinking, socially- and environmentally-responsible, democratic society.",research papers,2

If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life.

活该咯，父债子还，休学还是轻的，总有一天这会承受不住她爸带来的所有压力，压在她身上的一根稻草，就看什么时候……,恶意殴打他人者的妻女被网暴,1
如果他的父亲是被逼的做了什么错事或者一瞬间没有控制住自己做了伤天害理的事情有悔过之意，那么祸不及家人，不能伤害孩子。但是事实告诉我们他就是个十恶不赦的大坏蛋，当然要避开他的家人，难道要等着他花钱出来他女儿她妻子跟他告排挤她们的人的状，然后他又去伤害这些无辜的人的时候再远离他们吗？,恶意殴打他人者的妻女被网暴,1

理论上讲，确实不该网暴人家女儿。 但这只是理论，这种人的女儿肯定会被牵连的。因为哪怕是我这种比较理智的人，我的孩子如果和打人者的孩子一个学校，我一定会叮嘱孩子不要和她过多接触，甚至远离！ 父母的品行不端，孩子很难三观正。,恶意殴打他人者的妻女被网暴,0

【兼听则明】一位山东律师同行的观点：如果当时被害，一百多天尸体会腐烂成啥程度，有点常识的人都知道，估计只剩骨头了；如果现在才被害，这一百多天谁养着这个孩子或者说谁在拘禁这个孩子，目的是什么？现在为什么又要杀害这个孩子？既然一百多天都没有找到，杀害了偷偷处理掉不好，非得伪造成上吊？这跟投案自首有什么区别？真以为侦查机关连自杀和他杀都分不清楚？自杀是肯定的。只是这么长时间这个孩子干了些什么？……,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
把自杀的案件说成他杀，找出一个“杀人犯”来，然后将这个臆造出来的“故意杀人犯”枪毙，这种事情我们不是没有过，河南23岁青年魏清安、内蒙古青年呼格吉勒图、河北青年聂树斌就是这样被冤杀的。我想这不是网友想要的结果。,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
"若报道发现胡鑫宇的地点在仓库无误，那9成系自杀！红星新闻的报道，采访了胡母李女士。确认了胡鑫宇缢吊地点为金鸡山中一粮库，此前搜救的队伍有进过粮库大院，但没有进入仓库搜寻。若说法属实，案情则没有大的悬念了。

我曾采访过类似的案件，四川一女高中生失踪，数天后被发现溺亡，前面很多情节显得很离奇诡异，事前看他杀的可能很大，但最后的结果，铁证如山，是自杀。

这类案件，事件主角本人的背景信息很重要，比如成长环境、家庭家育、心理状态，更重要的还有日常行为。如果能将这些东西结合起来研判，更容易让我们普通人找到那个因为舆论的复杂性，而变得扑朔迷离的答案。

因为此前很多信息，舆论都偏向于阴谋论，而忽略了胡同学本身的一些信息点，比如是否厌学、厌世，与同学，老师，家庭的关系等等。",警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1

感觉是自杀吧 10.14 17时51分58秒在睢园方向离开视频监控范围之后再未发现胡鑫宇轨迹。中考后的暑假，胡鑫宇照旧去福建找妈妈玩。假期里李连英给他拍了很多照片。手机里他小时候的照片都被他以不好意思为由删掉了，暑假里竟然愿意拍照，李连英觉得挺难得。,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
其实主要是排除勒杀，因为如果有其他伤痕、或者现场有搏斗痕迹，或者死者手指等部位有搏斗痕迹甚至残存其他人的DNA信息，基本可以推定他杀。主要是被勒死和自杀上吊比较难区分，但在尸检层面也不难区分。（1）被勒杀的伤痕凹沟通常在脖子上呈现水平方向，因为攻击者通常是从两端横向勒紧绳索等索状物导致窒息死亡。（2）上吊自杀的伤痕凹沟则斜过颈部，痕迹与颈部存在较大的夹角，较高那端在靠近绳结方向。（3）需要注意的是，上吊自杀者颈部背面可能也存在擦伤、抓伤，这往往是自杀者自己应急反应造成的，这种伤痕不意味着存在他杀。晚安！,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
有个事儿我一直没搞明白， 杀他的动机到底是什么，就一破学校 而且校长都有不在场证明，他一个明显压力大 而且心理有点问题的一个人 杀他到底是什么目的呢？而且，到底是谁在网上散播被拿器官的声音的，为什么其他失踪案不说就说这起案件有？而且还有一件事我很好奇，为什么突然吧警察叫做 帽子？ 怎么突然就有了？ 还有不少自媒体吃人血馒头我也是服了 ,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
就是自杀吧，哪有这么牛逼的凶手啊,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
事情真相只有一个，如果我要推理错误。我直播吃一瓶辣椒酱。目前来看这就是自己想不开，至于什么原因想不开。目前不好判断，需要找到手机调出所有社交账号聊天记录。那么之前100多天没发现，可能是人手不足没有找那么仔细，后来所谓的地毯式搜索，也可能是一种夸张的说法。所以大家一直纠结的点，就在于几千人那么多天，多次地毯式搜索没找到。现在突然找到了，大家表示很奇怪。没什么好奇怪的，就是之前找的没有那么认真仔细。,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
如果这真的是他杀，那真是牛逼可以拍成电视剧了,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1

"个人认为是他遇到什么不好/不顺心的事了，甚至也有可能是知道了什么不好的东西被威胁，承受不住压力准备离开不见人。然后大家在找他。没找到他。
过了几天等大家不找后上吊自杀了。也有可能是在学校自杀了，但是学校怕栽赃，就把他自杀后的尸体吊外面了。今天才发现。死亡时间是大家搜查后的几天，死亡时间已有一两月。说是他杀的朋友，请问杀人动机是什么？警察或政府又为什么要帮凶手隐瞒？学校为什么要害一个15岁的孩子？没有道理嘛！是不是？",警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
个人判断胡鑫宇大概率是自杀，jc搜查漏了工作失职.理由如下: 1.胡是高中生，社会关系单一，不会得罪什么有权有势的人，舆论很早就发酵了，jc没必要也不敢刻意隐瞒。 2.警方肯定调查了胡身边所有有嫌疑的人，失踪100多天依然是失踪状态基本上是排除了身边人的作案嫌疑。 3.如果是他杀，完全可以找机会转移或者销毁尸体，没必要挂起来。 至于网上例如澎湃新闻这种吃人血馒头的媒体，恶意扭曲说封锁现场，制造阴谋论氛围。凡事有点智商的都知道是保护现场的需要。 最后还是要相信警方的公告，不要相信一些阴谋论。,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
自杀可能性大不？大！ 因为打电话的时候就已经说出他想哭 有点抑郁情绪了 但是疑点就是为什么那么多人搜 警犬搜 看望的亲朋 味道说了很大 但是为什么他们找不到呢？ 警察看不见闻不到很正常 但是警犬嗅觉灵敏 怎么可能一点线索没有,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
经公安部鉴定中心对录音笔内音频文件进行恢复，与胡某宇生前留存的语音进行声纹比对，结合调查情况，确定在现场提取封存的录音笔系胡某宇持有使用。通过对录音笔中的音频文件进行综合分析，录音内容不存在人为合成、篡改情况。2022年10月14日17时40分，23时08分胡某宇录制的两段音频清晰表达了自杀意愿。,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
"2月2日，江西省、市、县联合工作专班在上饶市铅山县召开新闻发布会，通报胡某宇事件调查情况。胡鑫宇系自缢死亡，尸体发现地系原始第一现场。胡鑫宇尸检情况：根据尸体腐败程度，结合当地环境及气候条件，胡鑫宇尸体符合长期暴露在室外的特征。胡鑫宇心理刻画情况：2022年9月到致远中学就读后，因学习成绩不佳造成心理落差，加之人际关系、青春期冲动带来的压力，造成了胡某宇失踪前心理状态失衡，表现为入睡困难、早醒、醒后难以再入睡等睡眠问题，存在注意力难以集中、记忆困难等认知功能障碍，存在内疚自责、痛苦、无力无助无望感、无意义感等情绪问题，进食出现异常，有明确的厌世表现和轻生倾向。胡鑫宇录音笔中录音内容不存在人为合成、篡改情况。2022年10月14日17时40分、23时08分胡某宇录制的两段音频清晰表达了自杀意愿。

⑤：发现尸体的粮库门口有门卫24小时值守并养有护院犬，未经许可禁止进入，警方先后于2022年10月20日、21日，11月26日、27日开展四次搜寻。但胡某宇尸体缢吊地点位于院内约9300平方米树林区域内，未搜寻到位。胡鑫宇生前异常表现：入睡困难、早醒、醒后难以再入睡等睡眠问题；注意力难以集中、记忆困难等认知功能障碍；进食出现异常，食欲减退，饭量减少；存在内疚自责、痛苦、无力无助无望感、无意义感等情绪问题。胡鑫宇事件发生后，网传胡鑫宇系“熊猫血”“尸体双脚平行地面”“发现地不是第一现场，尸体是后挂到树林中”均系谣言。警方回应鞋带能否承载胡鑫宇缢吊重量：胡某宇自缢使用的鞋带系涤纶材质，单根长147厘米，宽0.8厘米。经侦查试验，同款鞋带在缓慢拉伸状态下最大承重量85公斤。",警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,1
搜索过，不会没发现挂在树上的遗体，已死很久，那么按逻辑推断，发现遗体的不是第一现场。谁移动了遗体？自杀？他杀？逻辑推断一定是有用的，有人说逻辑推断没用，要当事人自己说行为意图。这种人不是用心不良就是天生弱智。 ,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0
一些匪夷所思的自杀经常会引起争议，比如轰动一时的“阜阳女子身中7刀被认定自杀”一案，在死者家属第二次提出复议后，山东省潍坊公安局出具的鉴定结论仍为自杀。在实际工作中，判断疑似自杀的他杀案件的性质具有一定难度，为防止死亡原因是在他人胁迫或诱骗下发生，防止他杀被伪装成溺死、自缢或高坠等状况，一般不能以死者具有自杀的可能性就定性为自杀，只有经现场勘验、尸体检验及背景调查等方面排除他杀后才能认定为自杀。,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0

"我分享了话题 结论一，胡非自杀。录音笔的存在代表不存在遗言，遗言应当放在宿舍等众人容易发现的地方，除去粮仓多次搜索而尸体才被发现的重大疑点外，10元钱也证明了胡并非有自杀倾向，要死的人带钱做什么？这么小的金额很可能是要去往某处包括回家或者远处散心。而储粮仓库作为粮食安全战略重地，并不是什么人可以自由进出，所以胡也不可能清楚内部结构而提前做好所谓自缢准备。结合10元、录音笔、粮仓、尸体转移等多因素，至此胡自杀可能性基本消除。他杀可能性接近100%。退一万步说即使录音笔有遗言，也要做好犯罪分子强迫录制甚至技术作假的可能。 结论二：作案过程
推测胡鑫宇是被犯罪集团绑架控制，始终处于学校或者储粮仓库某隐秘处，当地各路视频未能发现踪迹情况下，犯罪分子若已经转移胡鑫宇则可以在转移后的地点轻松处理，不会冒被发现风险再度回到案发地附近，故胡鑫宇始终就在学校不远处。而这个隐秘地点警犬未发现的或者发现后未上报的原因就在于存在一种力量在阻碍胡的发现，说明如果胡被发现背后的嫌疑人非常容易被挖掘出，综合地点就在附近和遗体发现过程的蹊跷，那么凶手是谁，相关力量如何配合作案，已经不难推断。结论三 高启强不可怕，可怕的是。。。",警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0

大胆猜测一下，为何尸体会突然吊在树上呢？如果想不留踪迹的谋害一个人，肯定是要生不见人，死不见尸的，做不到，大概率是没有毁尸灭迹的时间、条件、环境。毕竟操场埋尸案都被发现了，草草了事只会水落石出……退而求其次，做不到人间蒸发，那就“借绳上吊”欲盖弥彰？,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0

希望热度不要减，一直关注，看看后续会怎样？太蹊跷了吧，自杀后，尸体放了106天，怎么可能在原地106天没人发现呢？就隔了一墙之隔，肯定是最近有人把尸体放在这个地方的，要不不可能106天没人发现？骗傻子呢呀，希望胡鑫宇的母亲能一直坚持寻求真相，凶手不能一直一手遮天吧,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0

自杀的话是要有蹬的东西才能完成 再说三个月吊在那里，风吹日晒 早就白骨了 报道说 不是原来面貌 就是说不是面目全非 不是面目全非说明死亡时间不久 那这三个多月 人在哪 地毯式搜索都没有找到 警犬土狗都出动 何况偏偏年后这个时候被发现 又是开学期,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0
要是自杀也有疑点啊！首先自杀上吊你总有东西蹬吧?现在有这个玩意吗？(还未出更详细的)第二，无论自杀还是他杀，要么胡在刚失踪的前期已经死亡了，那当时的地毯式搜索是真的搜不到吗？现在怎么就又搜到了呢(这么近，要么当时地毯式真的没搜到，要么就是没搜) 第三，难道是躲了一阵子才上吊的?请问他如何保障他的食物和水，他除非自己藏有大量的食物，不然他迟早要出去寻找，而出去不会被人发现吗？,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0
可能就是近期才上吊的，那他前几个月的水食物如何保障?他难不成一直躲在山里面?他总会出去寻找食物吧！出去的话外面那么多人找，会看不见他?难不成他自己储存有够他将近100多天生存的食物和水吗？,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0
自杀可能性极低，被害可能性更大，失踪106天，100米位置，上万人搜索，救生犬，这么高频次的地毯式搜索，怎么可能发现不了，人不可能吊那么久 是有人制造作案现场，还是有人搜救时故意绕开那块区域。整个案件，扑朔迷离，更离谱。希望真相大白，还家属公道,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0
感觉还是他杀概率比较大，就是不懂能不能找出凶手。被发现的地方，距离学校初中部最近距离仅有80米，多次地毯式搜索没有发现，这么大个人如果吊在那儿，不可能看不到，所以排除当时已经吊在那里。那就是说明当时在其他地方，如果自己躲的，这么久应该要吃东西，60多天的时候还在找人，也没发现，人60多天不吃东西，是活不了的，所以也不可能再有后面自己上吊。那就很可能是当时已经被凶手杀害，隐藏了尸体，后面挂上去。,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0
想想也知道，一个高中生， 可能躲避当地所有的监控摄像吗？ 在学校附近藏匿，可能躲过警犬的鼻子吗？ 自杀的话，他又是脚下踩着什么把自己脖子放到绳圈里的呢？ 为什么警方以及多方摸排之前都没有在这片区域找到尸体？ 假设死亡时间是100多天的话，尸体早应该巨人观了，即使是近一个月死亡的也应该腐烂不成样了。这就说明了，如果是一个月之内死亡的话，那就说明前一段时间里肯定是被关在不知道什么地方了。现在凶手迫于舆论不得已将胡的尸体吊出来，原因以及动机……可能只有录音笔的内容能解开了。但这么多天，录音笔是否还是当时的录音笔？录音笔里的内容有没有被删除或者篡改？我们都不得而知。,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0

当地居民提供的线索是：胡鑫宇被发现时“衣服烂了，人体组织有腐化”，殡仪馆的官方人士也表示遗体已经不是原来的样貌了。再加上，尸体被发现的地点距离胡鑫宇就读的“致远中学”直线距离不足百米，以及胡鑫宇的一位家属表示搜救人员曾多次筛查这里，他们家属也去搜过，但全都没发现小胡的踪迹。其实，能够推断出一个基本的结论，那就是，胡鑫宇是遭遇他杀一段时间之后，又被挂在了尸体发现地伪装成“自缢身亡”的。当然啦，真正最终确认还需要更多的佐证，比如，从胡鑫宇穿的衣服上提取“土壤样本”，与尸体发现地的土壤样本进行对比，就能知道，胡鑫宇的尸体是不是被移动过。,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,0

我很认同这种观点，胡鑫宇失踪后，舆论都偏向于阴谋论，确实忽略了很多有价值的信息点。既然当初到达了粮仓，为啥不进去寻找？有时候，生死只在某些人的一念之间。围观者预设立场，把目标定性为他杀，人为地失去了寻找胡鑫宇的最佳机会，是多么的可惜！现在要证明胡鑫宇自杀，除了录音笔外，还有一个佐证的思路：查清胡鑫宇的吃住地，如果他不是离校后第一时间自杀，那么，他很可能吃住在粮仓内，也可能在粮仓内或者附近留下自行吃住的痕迹，包括残留食物、大小便痕迹等。,警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,2

"以下言论仅个人猜测。具体情况以警方调查结果为主。我猜测，最初地毯式寻找的时候，人根本就不在山上，而是躲藏起来了。甚至有可能有其他人协助躲藏，并未告知公众。当然这个可能性较低。其次就是死亡时间。从10月份失踪，到现在被发现遗体，还是吊缢。这个就得看尸检结果。判定具体死亡时间，死亡原因。是自缢，还是死后被吊起来。以及尸检结果可以看出是否受过外伤。如果没有受过伤，那可以大致推断出死亡时间。只要确定大致死亡时间，也能推断出一些线索。然后就是录音笔里的信息，是否会有重要内容。一切都等待最终调查结果公布。

浅谈满江红成本 个人觉得成本高低不能决定影片内涵与质量，满江红成本我一个外行人看都知道是低的，但这片子是精彩的，性价比高的。收益高不仅是因为成本低，更与好的剧本、好的演员、好的音效有关。所以成本低不能是满江红被矛头所指的原因，相反我们应该宣扬此类“高性价比”电影，激励该行业的编导们动脑子拍出有文化以及人文价值的东西。有人会觉得那会不会所有人都去拍低成本片了？不会的。术业有专攻，人各有志。有人有兴趣就会去拍高成本高制作片，比如春节同期的流浪地球和深海。作为观众我们需要对中国编导制作人有信心，并给予鼓励和支持。以上是肯定的。接下来说下拍片的问题，我的结论是：不应该垄断。好的电影宁愿延长放映期，而不是抢占排片。让所有的影片公平竞争，根据受欢迎程度适量更改，而不是垄断。希望中国电影百花齐放，薪火相传。,满江红起诉大V,1

被起诉造谣方是没有资格要求对方公开合同和账本的，但是你说人家洗钱就要提供证据支持，但明显没法提供，所以除非和解不然官司肯定是输的。这种官司除非是直接利益相关方或者公诉，否则发行方在这场官司中不需要提供证据证明自己没有洗钱，但是造谣的一方却必须提供证据证明对方洗钱才有可能胜诉。,满江红起诉大V,0

" 一场大戏就这么结束了？这也太搞笑了，而且这个回应啊，属实是有点……就不说什么“造谣者”完全是偏方的主观臆测了，就说底下这段话，简直就是糟糕公关的典型代表！

首先“希望理性观影，不要再掐了”，可是官博当初发的可是“跟我斗，你们还差的远呢……“，这不就是赤果果的挑衅嘛？合着你们可以挑衅别人，别人不能掐你们？

第二，“大V有一定话语权……不当言论会影响片方利益”。可是什么是不当言论呢？是不符合你利益的言论就是不当言论么？谁来界定这个言论当与不当？而且，大V的不当言论可以显示出来，那普通网友的所谓“不当言论”是不是就被某些不可名状的力量弄没了？还有，春节期间，无数大V扯脖子喊，利用个人影响力把网友忽悠进电影院，然后好多人都觉得那些大V吹的有点过，这算不算是“不当言论”呢？

第三，也是最搞笑的一句话：“我们和其他部门和大V沟通过，少部分坚持观点，我们没办法”。这就是赤果果的告诉别人，我们找大V 了，一些我们给钱了，或者“以德服人”了，于是就被“公关”了，另一些大V，给钱人家不要，讲理也讲不过，没招了。

合着你们的电影，说不定，不允许有背面声音，如果有所谓的不符合你们利益的“不当言论”，就想各种办法去解决说话的人呗？这让我想起一句话，解决不了电影问题，就解决提出问题的人。

当然还有好多槽点，就不一一吐槽了。

要我说啊，满江红的片方，赶紧换一批宣发吧，是在不行就换一批真读过书的做题家，亡羊补牢嘛，要不官博发一篇满江红整出10个错别字，所谓的回应也全是漏洞和破绽，要不就真的花大价钱，把你们口中那几个所谓的“造谣”大V雇过来，人家微博帖子那个撰文水平，逻辑的严谨程度，可是完全吊打你们的这些宣发了呢。

"事情发展到现在，《满江红》影片运营方应该要承认，他们有4个地方是做得不太好：1、拿秦桧诬陷岳飞的“莫须有”自证清白；2、官博不知道“靖康”是一个年号；3、岳飞忌日不纪念，连发数条微博，尽和网友扯口舌…4、起诉大V。大v文章我看了，有的是善意劝告，他却把别人告了。有点敌友不分。

前期放一些幕后花絮、记者采访都挺好。像我这种观众，就很喜欢去了解拍摄中的趣事，去发现电影里的细节。

可后面，运营方把自己放在网友的对立面，一本正经地叫冤、指责，还起诉……

就让人感觉玩不起了。毕竟你赚了那么多钱，有人指指点点也正常。

根据我这两年当博主的经验，在微博上，一定要“姿态软”，然后，只关注自己该关注的。

为什么要姿态软？因为互联网是草根文化。你越强硬、越一本正经，越引人反感。姿态软，才容易被人接纳。咱不是经常说“通情达理”吗？情绪到了，理才能达到。

只关注自己该关注的，这点很好理解。因为互联网上声音太多太杂，你都注意，顾不过来。

比如，《满江红》运营方应该关注的是：电影大卖。所以，卖得好，感谢下大家支持。

另外，你是内容创作者，应该多多分析作品，这是你的强项。和和气气，带大家多理解构思，惊叹导演73高龄做到这样的突破，而不是盯着黑粉。

说真的，当你关注黑粉时，你的眼里就只有黑粉，太拉低作品的艺术成就了，也埋没了几千艺术工作者的努力。

韩红的片尾曲多好听，一如既往的温暖大气。片中那些锣鼓一样的音乐，据说都有隐喻。告诉我们吧？

还有，我觉得，黑粉开始并没有那么多。还有很多关注作品本身的观众，要不不会初三开始靠口碑逆袭。

后来黑粉多，一部分是看不惯运营方的“一本正经”。太容易让人联系到古板、生硬、道貌岸然的领导了。

好好解释，疏忽/写错了的地方改正下，把关注点拉回作品本身。

柔软点。和气生财、闷声发大财。

电影本身还是好电影。

别搅和进口水战，吵不赢的。

"电影《满江红》通过官博晒出电子诉讼平台截图，表示“部分用户通过网络平台捏造有关电影《满江红》的不实信息并大量传播，严重危害了影片的合法权益，现正式对以下造谣者提起诉讼。”

今日下午，电影官博连发数条回应争议，包括“莫须有 欲加之罪何患无辞”、“清者自清”、“抄袭之谈，实属无稽！故事虽为虚构，主创团队从未泯灭赤诚之心”等。

26日，电影《满江红》发声明，表示诸如“幽灵场” “偷票房” “买票房” “资本操控” “抄袭”等指责均为无稽之谈，纯属造谣。对此各出品方正在收集证据，并已开始依法通过诉讼等方式维护影片合法权益。",满江红起诉大V,2

"《满江红》看来是春节档最有争议的了，会持续关心起诉的进程，虽然从公关角度，起诉对《满江红》其实非常不利，因为不管输赢都会影响口碑，但我是从学习角度来看这个事，感觉非常有价值。言论固然自由，但信口开河也是不行，制作成本超不超一千万、有没有偷票房等，要看是否能够提供证据，希望全程公开，庭审也能直播。
现在很多用户的说法其实是错误的，表明对法律的确不了解，不过也没兴趣指出来，这个起诉事件大概也是普法的过程。

又阴阳话题啊,满江红起诉大V,2
"《满江红》为什么起诉？《满江红》起诉了微博上的几个大V，对这个问题，不同人有不同的看法。其实本来就是这样，中国这么大，人口这么多，不同人对同一问题有不同看法很正常。《满江红》起诉这件事，也应该是这个原则。

我个人认为《满江红》之所以起诉大V，原因可能是是客观的环境影响。

中国经过疫情这几年，院线的电影几乎没有任何上线，更是基本上没有任何盈利。再加上我们社会现在对电影创作的诸多客观复杂的情况，中国电影可以说这几年非常艰难。很多人已经不敢投资电影。

在这个时候，非常需要几部重磅的片子出来，而且票房一定要可以，其作用除了投资人本身赚钱以外。还有一个重要的文化意义上的影响，那就是提振一下中国电影市场的信心。

不同人视角不同，观点可能完全不同。在这个意义上，《满江红》、《流浪地球》这几部片子，具有特殊的象征意义。他们能否成功，象征中国电影市场行、中国电影市场好、投资中国电影可以赢。这是在经济利益之后文化层面的考量。

所以，无论是出品方还是制作方还是导演还是演员，他们努力的一切就是希望在疫情防控进入新时期的中国，以中国电影票房，提振一下各方面的信心。

大家对电影有不同的观影体验，这个也完全可以理解。我自己带孩子看了，我觉得非常好，镜头、配乐、思想都很积极很正面，用小人物的牺牲精神呈显出很多中国文化传统中宝贵的东西。

可不可以批评电影？这个当然是可以。但是电影正在营销的高潮时期，如果不对一些在出品方看来不客观的评论进行回应，很大程度上会影响电影的口碑。

而社会大众，我们部分观众具有一定的从众心里，看到网上说好，大家可能都去看。看到一些特别负面的评论，特别是一些关乎诚实信用等社会底线层面的评论，可能很多观众就不去看了。这个对投资人而言，会是一个非常大的损失。

不回应不行，回应不坚决也不行，怎么办才是最好的办法？尽管不同人有不同的看法，但是法律可能是今天我们社会最大的一个公约数。于是《满江红》选择了起诉。我觉得这可能是《满江红》起诉的原因。

当然，不同人对法律的态度也是不一样的，对诉讼的态度，更是千差万别。

当然，另一方面说，司法是效率不是很高的一种争议解决方式。

比如现在提交立案材料，法院可能过好几个月才能给你审核，审核还可能不通过，通过后还要等待法院的排期庭审，一来二去，走完诉讼程序，可能是一年甚至两三年后的事情了。

当然，如果法院考虑到舆情重大，特事特办，也有可能让这批案件，进入快速通道，犀利咔嚓快速审完，这也未必不可能。所以，很多事情，都不绝对。

但是，客观的讲，中国确实需要在电影等文化领域，引领一下经济快速发展的劲头。

我自己觉得中国现在需要普遍的经济大发展、社会大繁荣。当然，不同人对这个问题，观点也不完全一致。

既然经过诉讼，我觉得不需要过多讲什么，耐心等待诉讼结果就可以了。

我想，经过一段时间的沉淀后，我们再去看满江红，不论这个片子大家怎么评价，我个人都希望，经过满江红、流浪地球等2023年新春档的电影，中国电影世界进入一个腾飞的阶段，也由此人们的消费水平、经济的繁荣程度都迈上一个大台阶。

这是一个期望，也是一种期待。",满江红起诉大V,2

点到为止，适可而止，任何事情都不能太过分了。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
女生怎么就原谅了，网友们还没有发话呢？ 这种事情当事人并没有觉得有太大的问题，然而网友们并不乐意纷纷一直在说，要追究猥亵的责任，还说对方一直是违法的。 我都想说，当事人都不追究关你们什么事？,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
本来就不是啥大事情，还准备立案?撕扯个雨衣不就为了曾加下气氛，还要上纲上线到什么地步?这女的本来也是准备去玩的啊，觉得不开心下次不去了呗，各路媒体有什么好炒作的！还逼得人家各部门都要介入，烦不烦！一个泼水节本来泼水就是送祝福，传统，现在好了，好好一个节日给你上纲上线，揪住个别情况不放，搞成这样，开心了吧?,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
泼水节狂欢，别让祝福变了味。近日，云南傣历1385泼水节的视频引发了公众对其是否流氓化的质疑。在有些视频中，有人趁乱扯拽女子衣服，有人涉嫌侵犯他人隐私，引起了人们对泼水节的关注和讨论。对于这样一个富有几千年历史的传统节日，该如何平衡其现代化需求和文化传承呢？泼水节是少数民族的民俗节日，这种打破边界感的狂欢节并不多见。对于当地民众以及参与者来说，对这样一个传统节日是有预期的，也包括心理层面的准备。然而，如何保障人们的安全和活动的和谐性是一个难题。在以往泼水节多用的是盆，但现在多用水枪等攻击性更强的工具。因此，我们必须解决在满足人们现代需求的同时，保持文化传承和庆祝方式的问题。针对泼水节面临的问题，有人说应该合理发展民俗文化，对具有狂欢性质的泼水节，不必上纲上线地大加挞伐，甚至污名化。即不让泼水节祝福变了味，也不要过度规范失去鲜明特色。在未来的泼水节中，有人说可以加强管理，提高文明意识。其实傣族泼水节对国外朋友是很有吸引力的，可以借鉴其他国家的庆典活动，在其基础上，逐步推进泼水节的现代化进程。只有这样，泼水节才能真正成为一个独特的文化品牌，吸引更多民族文化爱好者参与其中。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
掑撕雨衣这事可大可小，要是没发到网络，或者关注的热度小一点，其实就是一小事，只不过现在热度起来了，那就是一件大事了，甚至连当地官方都不得不出来调查。其实从撕衣男子动作初衷就可以看出，他的本意是想撕掉对方的雨衣，而不是撕对方的衣服，网上很多人把这两个概念混淆，认为撕雨衣就等同于是撕衣服，这是不对的。撕雨衣只是在当时的特定环境及氛围下，做出的一个不理智的行为，如果换个场合，他肯定干不出这事来。而撕衣服则是耍流氓，是违法行为，放在哪都是不被允许的。泼水节本质是一个少数民族的节日，之所以吸引这么多人去当地体验，就是被他们的节日氛围所感染，在这种氛围下很容易让人模糊边界感，见人就泼水，管你认不认得，先泼了再说。此时每个人都释放了天性，行为动作变得格外大胆，在一些事情的尺度上没有把握好，好心办了坏事。就像婚闹一样，即要保证婚礼热闹，让大家感受到结婚的喜庆，又不能闹的太过，让新郎新娘下不来台，所以此时就该多包容，对一些不太出格的行为多多理解，而不是苛刻的指责。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
其实女生这么选择也能理解，毕竟她一个女生，如果真的非要报案，会不会招来该男子的报复？而且最后就算立案了，惩罚估计也会很低，最多拘留几天就放出来了，只能说犯罪成本真的很低,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
其实心里不知道有多高兴呢微博上的女泉气的到处跳脚，结果人家当事人一点也不在乎小仙女笑话永不过时,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
她男的虽然不对，脑子不太好，但本质不一定坏的，泼水节，他只是想女的多遭遇水攻击，记得，他没撕女子衣服，而是雨衣。个人支持她选择不立案，这不是她懦弱，而是她相对通情达理。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
反正本来也不认识也不想以后再有交集，这辈子再也不想听到这件事相关，于是选择不立案让这个事赶紧结束，从女生角度出发这样想不也很正常。舆论中心的当事人又不是上帝视角，上帝视角的网友又不能把人家替出来。大家包括我也希望扯衣服的被追责留案底，但是因为不立案就指责当事人是否过分魔怔了,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
上善若水，厚德载物。对这个女生来说，做出这个决定是非常正常合理的。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
尊重当事人的选择，她作为受害者，有权利选择如何处理此事。只要不是公诉刑事案件，当事人的意见还是比较重要。 每个人都要控制自己的言行，涉事男子的不文明行为会得到相应的惩罚。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
这都有人骂，某些流氓不要太离谱，给脸不要脸,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
"女生选择不立案，显然是怕将来受到报复。从现实情况来说，这类社会事件发酵之后，带来的各种影响相当多。甚至有可能造成人们难以预料的情况，可以说女生采取这个决定，也是有深入的思考，可以说是得饶人处且饶人的想法。我们从道德观念以及法律角度来说，撕扯女性衣服，这种行为是不道德的，也是非法的。这些撕扯女子雨衣的人，理所应当受到法律惩处，可是受害人选择不立案，也是息事宁人的做法，也属于正常的抉择。我们旁观事件的人，可以继续痛斥这些撕扯衣服的流氓，但不能继续鼓动女生去立案，她有权做出自己的选择。希望女生早日走出这段经历的阴影，好好生活，保重身体。

",泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
这位女生的宽容和理解是值得我们学习的。虽然这个男子的行为是不可原谅的，但是女生选择不立案，也是在给他一个机会去反思自己的行为，改正错误。我们生活中难免会遇到一些不愉快的事情，但是我们可以选择宽容和理解，让自己更加从容和坚强。希望这个事件能够引起更多人的关注和反思，让我们一起营造一个更加和谐、友爱的社会。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
这事本来就没啥大不了的，没必要上纲上线，它就是在特定环境，特定氛围下做出相对出格的举动，应该说是没有恶意的，这和素质没关系，说人家耍流氓就更是过人了。虽然过程中给女生造成一定困扰，但绝对没对她造成伤害，只不过有些自媒体为了流量，胡乱瞎带节奏，扯上性别、地域等话题将整个事件带偏了。当然了视频中男子的做法肯定要不得，还是要感谢女生的大度原谅。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
这个案件很简单嘛 就是和婚闹一样说着热闹之事行猥亵之实 还用辩论嘛  女生选择不报案，是出于自身保护的想法 还是出于包容的想法，都不重要 作为猥亵行为 被害人的意愿只是被害人的意愿 作为涉嫌刑法行为造成如此大的社会影响 国家机关采取公诉，采取判罚 也没啥不妥 当然，我也建议如果要处罚，请妇联等机构保护好这个女生的安全 我觉得这个事情挺简单的道理 热闹≠为所欲为，猥亵行为也≠普通玩闹 人性的善恶遵循自然之道 心里想的是什么 行为就看的出来 所以即使说的天花乱坠 违法犯罪也变不成普通玩闹 另外，撕雨衣行为本身是坏，不用论了 但是如果再在这为坏的行为洗地 去为了这个坏行为打扰那个女生 就是真正的恶了 劝各位向善，别堕入恶道,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1
人家立不立案跟你有什么关系 不按你想的就说纵容 反过来讲这女生 一天天怎么这么闲,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,1

理智上可以理解女生为什么不立案。可是我觉得这就是社会对女性的压迫之一，女生如果选择立案，那些别人对他的指指点点、无端指责、受害者有罪论，都会影响他的生活。可是这个女生选择原谅了，其他女孩子怎么办。有了这么一个先例，下次其他猥琐男就会把这件事当成功案例【都上微博热搜那男的都能被原谅，我可以用一样的非凡猥亵美女】。而下一个受害女孩，会不会被这个先例压迫着，【你看之前那个美女都原谅，就你高贵玩不起】，下一个受害者，会不会被迫【原谅】？而且，这不仅是女性的事，被人撕雨衣本身就是错的。换成一个男孩子，被大妈撕开衣服往重要部分喷水，男孩一样会不舒服。更甚受害男孩会因为有【女孩原谅先例】，被压迫着不能追究这件事，否则必定有键盘侠说【男的怎么也计较，人家女孩都没他事多】。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,0
撕雨衣这是人干的事? 这不是性骚扰难道是少数民族的特有祝福? 而且，别以为我们汉族不知道，泼水节指的是拿水盆，从肩膀处浇下去，代表着祝福。 拿水枪呲女性敏感部位，叫尼玛祝福? 你们的妈妈当年也是被一圈男人拿水呲着长大的呗？,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,0
"你去海边游泳，去泡个温泉，有人披着浴巾，会给扯下来么。专泼好看会透的，为的是什么。更有甚者，拿个泼水枪，专门滋重点部位，这是在祝福，还是耍流氓。这是另一种，得不到的就诋毁。

又想玩水，又不想透，完全可以兼得。却被说成，你为何要来，玩不起就走，别小心眼。但重点是，撕雨衣的行为，根本就是在骚扰。

趁着节日，出门占便宜，趁着人多，趁机摸一把。就是这种害群之马，让人望而却步，不敢尽情享受，只能避而远之，让传统文化蒙羞。

原谅是原谅，犯错是犯错，该警告就要警告。更要加强监管，别让小人有机可乘，这种人多的活动，往往是猥亵重灾区，很多女性都被伤害过。

比起好看的女生，加班应酬，劳无所得，降薪裁员的打工人，更需要被祝福。 ",泼水节女生选择原谅对方,0

我们不应该把“泼水节”当作对别人进行无理骚扰和欺凌的借口，而应该尊重他人的隐私和人格，坚持边界意识，保护每个人的尊严和安全。当然，这并不代表我们应该全盘否定“泼水节”，而是应该明确，人们反对的是那些借着“泼水节”名头进行超越边界的恶劣行径，凡事总有个度。在传统的“泼水节”中，人们以泼水祈求吉祥、幸福、洗净污秽，互相泼水表达彼此关爱和祝福。然而，在那些流传出来的视频中，被泼水、被水枪攻击的人都非常明显地表现出了尴尬、抗拒和痛苦，而那些泼水者却依然不依不饶，甚至起哄嘲笑，这完全背离了传统节日的初衷，充满了恶意和不良行为。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,0

【撕扯雨衣男子已经受到谴责，希望到此为止】 近日，女生在云南景洪市“泼水节”活动中被人撕扯雨衣的视频引发网络热议。视频账号“YY阿哈哈”拍摄的视频显示，众人在马路边围成一个圈用水枪对该女子喷水，还有男子在撕扯女子身上的雨衣。4月17日，被撕扯雨衣的当事人黄女士告诉红星新闻记者，目前网络热议的部分说法与当时情况不一致。比如，当时她并未感觉到有人专门泼自己的私密部位，但她同时认为，撕扯雨衣这样的行为非常不妥。据了解，视频曝光后，撕扯雨衣的人受到舆论压力。视频拍摄者、黄女士的朋友张先生（化姓）告诉记者，他们已选择不提出予以立案。对于网友提出的为何没有上前帮助黄女士的质疑，张先生表示拍摄视频时，他被人群围在了外面，把手机举得很高，没有看清事发当时黄女士被撕扯雨衣的经过，后来回放视频看到具体的情况，才感到不妥。云南景洪市文旅局工作人员告诉红星新闻记者，此事已经由当地公安部门处理完毕。如果游客遇到类似的旅游不文明现象，可以拨打投诉中心电话，或者使用APP“一部手机游云南”投诉，工作人员通常会在24小时内处理。该工作人员说，泼水节是傣族的传统节日，向别人身上洒一点水表示祝福，而且要求用干净的水。一些游客不太清楚泼水节的具体庆祝方式，旅游过程中可能会出现一些不文明现象。今后会要求景区及时制止这种不文明的行为，出台相应的规范措施。  泼水节被撕雨衣女生发声：撕扯雨衣男子已经受到谴责，希望到此为止,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,2

"记者能联系到当事人“黄女士”并进行采访，说明当事人的身份能否确认，但是却没有关于视频中撕扯雨衣的男士的后续报道，是找不到这个人还是无法联系，还是联系了对方不配合？

如果黄女士坚持立案，她面对的社会压力以及维权所付出的时间精力成本，应该不比这位男士低，毕竟大家都知道她是“黄女士”了。综合评估之下，她放弃维权，也在理解之中。

与其关注黄女士是否选择立案，不如去问问撕扯雨衣的男士有无道歉、是何心理、生活是否受影响。

都在说男方可能“社死”，这大概是一厢情愿的想法。",泼水节女生选择原谅对方,2

撕扯雨衣铁定是错误的，无需赘言。咱现在就是一个好奇，上游新闻在采访拍摄者“龙非凡”的时候曾提及，被撕扯雨衣的女生是他的朋友，有男生拿着水枪往女生的私密部位喷。但是，在红星新闻采访当事人的稿件中，当事人否认了被喷私密部位。这里面提到的张先生自称是发视频的人，也是当事人的朋友，这里又否认了女生被猥亵，也斥责被喷私密部位是博眼球的说法。请问，“龙非凡”跟张先生是同一个人吗？如果是的话，前后说辞为何矛盾呢？,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,2
近日，云南迎来一年一度的泼水节，热闹场景持续在网络刷屏。与此同时，有女生在“泼水节”被过度泼水的视频也引发争议。泼水节打水仗能活跃节日氛围，但玩闹不等于可以乱来。借泼水的机会耍流氓，如此越线的性骚扰行为和婚闹一样，不单纯是文明不文明的问题，更涉嫌违法。拿风俗当借口，对游客进行骚扰，既不尊重女性，也折射出一些人法治观念的淡漠。而且从报道来看，泼水节不文明的行为还远不止于此。比如，有的故意对骑车经过的游客泼水，导致骑行者视线模糊、重心不稳，这同样影响公共安全。在当事人网上控诉后，不少网友表示“不敢去了”，这对地方形象无疑是一种伤害。一个地区要想让风俗更好地传承，而不是被一些无边界、无底线的流氓行为带偏，首先应该维护好活动秩序，对一些越界行为依法严肃处理。对此，你怎么看？（光明网）,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,2

"#少放鞭炮让环卫工回家# 鞭炮是我国的传统,不要因此而一点点抹掉大家的年味。少放鞭炮,那卖鞭炮做鞭炮的呢？他们大春节的在外面做生意也不容易。不放炮,小孩子年三十干什么？LOL？打麻将？ 每天宣传这些有什么用,给她们涨工资，纳入编制,让他们也可以买起房。也不枉费他们的付出… |南新街",春节放鞭炮,1

#评论#【您的“割爱”正是公民的担当】在春节的脚步日益临近，我们刚刚送走又一场雾霾之时，烟花爆竹放还是不放？两种观点几乎打成平手。不放或者少放鞭炮，看似一件简单的小事，却需要公民意识的觉醒，需要每一位公民的担当，并将这种环保的责任和担当融入日常生活的点滴中。为了蓝天，请您“割爱”。,春节放鞭炮,0

iPhone SE黄屏的问题，其实在之前的iPhone 5和iPhone 5S刚上市的时的情况如出一辙，并不算什么新鲜事儿～按照官方解释和以往的经验来看，这是粘合剂在干燥的过程中，会让屏幕出现发黄的现象。一般来说，这种情况在正常使用过程中慢慢消失。回头看看5、5S、5C就清楚了了。SE的按键松动倒是确实存在的,IphoneSE,2

今年春节放鞭炮的明显的少了。出于安全的考虑，城市高层小区内禁放，农村住宅也放一些安全系数高的鞭炮，比如开天雷和大地红。但是污染还是存在，尤其是在初二早晨祭祖，这是从除夕开始放的最多最密集的时候，过了这一天就不用担心早晨被爆竹惊醒了。,春节放鞭炮,0

操，出政策还有准谱吗？你说不能生就不能生，你说能生就能生，你说多生就多生，你说少生就少生......政府政策如果延续性，那么政府的信用度在哪里？做决策的时候不论证不问民意吗？应该是不论证不问民意的，否则这么会做这么多傻逼的决定……,开放二胎,0

深圳关于禁摩限电的最新一轮疯狗行动已经接近大功告成了，据说有上万部电动车被没收，几百人被拘留(有点怀疑会不会那么多)。举国一片骂声之下，很多人疑惑，究竟为啥，深圳市领导要采取如此粗暴到弱智的措施呢,深圳禁摩限电,0
可见埃尔多安才是正义的，俄罗斯是打折反恐的幌子轰炸叙利亚反对派，为巴沙尔政府撑腰打气。俄罗斯确实也轰炸极端组组，但是俄罗斯必然也轰炸叙利亚反对派，不然巴沙尔会引狼入室跟俄罗斯同流合污吗？,俄罗斯在叙利亚的反恐行动,0

#【禁烟花？】#春节放鞭炮，若干年前我对禁止令强烈反对，因为这是一个行不通且伤害本来就无多少娱乐的民众感情，自从PM2.5日益高攀之后，我开始支持限制燃放，毕竟好环境对我们太稀缺了，但考虑到数千年的传统，我觉得不妨借鉴凯撒大帝的胡子税的做法——征收燃放税，而不是清朝留头不留发的做法。,春节放鞭炮,1
