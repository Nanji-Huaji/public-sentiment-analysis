"""and making it easier to hire and fire workers"" This is the type ideological blather the makes people hate economists. Making it easier to fire people reduces wages and in the short term may lead to higher growth by stimulating investment. But then in a decade or so the consumer base you use to have run out of savings, are loaded up with debt and are systematically replaced with a new generation of workers who are paid less, have fewer benefits and less disposable income. Demand start to slip, investment opportunities in the real economy dry up and the next thing you know you have Apple sitting on a mountain of cash because they have run out of consumers who can afford their products and they can make more money out of financial speculation than trying to create profitable products that are cheap enough for an impoverished proletariat. Continuously narrowing your consumer base and expecting long term stability is just plain dumb.

Happens to me all the time. Some walker without even looking just ambles off the sidewalk, his back to me, right in front of my path. Also when traffic turns through a bike lane this involves extra lights and a real cluster mix situation for everyone. And don't get me started about trucks parking in cycle lanes to unload - all the time. And lastly, the worst is car drivers get to shout ""get in the bike lane"" now when I""m going around a truck or something. Bloomberg's ideas have little to do with reality, he's green the way most billionaires are green. One other thing, those electric bikes, they are a true menace.

What I do know however, is that other countries, with lesser wealth than the USA, all have high speed rail, up and running and have for decades now.! Yes,stop corporate welfare, to the likes of Exxon, which runs to a few billion dollars annually and the conglomerate agribusiness hand outs, that are welfare, no matter how you look at it.!

"Dred Scott vs Sanford. I should probably end right there. But, yes to the question, I would still be ashamed--the (unjust) revisings of Law by the Justice's (or appellate judge's) command today are neither few nor small nor non-horrible. And don't forget that the guilded age was created, aided, and abetted by the similarly high-handed Lochner Court, damaging society by, say, effectively criminalizing unions (and letting employers enforce that by not-rare murders of any organizers) and many other things, for, what 40 years or so? Until the most powerful president thus far in history FDR forced them to change course just so he could stop them blocking his efforts to fight the Great Depression? And now we are told, in rulings that are nonsense when compared with the text of the 1st amendment they purportedly derive from, that 'money is speech', along with the power of rich and business over politicians? Oh--right, I was supposed to leave that one out. I would be ashamed. Dred Scott.",supreme court,0

"#12 elizabeth: Right on about the continued importance of French! French is spoken as a native or near-native language by something like 200 million people (most of whom are not French). If you add a few hundred million more non-native speakers and consider the global distribution of places where French is important to commerce and politics, it is obviously one of the most widely spoken and influential languages in the world - and the numbers are growing, not falling. French-speaking Africa is experiencing some of the highest rates of population growth in the world, and incidentally contains a large chunk of the world's untapped supplies of oil, uranium, and other natural resources. Meanwhile, France is the only major European power whose population is actually growing, and is on track to become Western Europe's most populous country in just a few decades; so the future of French as a pan-European language also looks bright. So yes, French is a heavy hitter as global languages go. In some parts of the world, it is indispensable for diplomacy and business. So maybe - just maybe - it would be a good idea for our universities to keep teaching it.",colleges,1

"Professor Nussbaum speaks a vital truth. We have a constant push for more science and mathematics, more technology majors. The assumption is that we are losing the international sweepstakes if we don't excel other nations in these fields. We want to make the Faustian bargain, in which we choose to gain the whole world, technical ascendancy, by forfeiting our soul, the humanities.

The greedy gutless wonders in the GOP who want to dismantle a system that works (Medicare) rather than to continually improve on it are the slithering heels who are not subject to any of the ill will they recklessly want to inflict on the nation. They go merrily along with salary and pensions they have not even come close to earning and lifelong medical care. So why should they care? Congress should be required to live in and depend on the realities they wish to impose on Americans.,medicare,1
"Memories are SHORT. The reason for Medicare in the first place was because seniors could not afford to pay insurance. As we get older, we have more health problems. I'm 77 ... had breast cancer 3 times. Try paying for that! Then, last year I broke my right femur in a fall. No way I could have paid for that. Insurance has to charge more for seniors period. Many seniors only have social security for support. $1348.00 a month does not buy much. We must keep Medicare as we know it.",medicare,1

In a chaotic world, getting more chaotic all the time, children need continuity and structure to focus on learning and some sense of security that the people who care about them will be there. Schools......aren't.......businesses........at least, they shouldn't be. If a school were run the way all the deformers would have it, there would be a revolving door of teachers in and out every 2 - 3 years, based on who is getting the polished apples or not.

"I found Professor Brennan's view elitist and arrogant. He has been fortunate enough to have had an education and now sits in judgement on those whom he perceives as to stupid to vote, and as he politely intimates would spoil his nice little educated democracy. Mandatory voting does not mean you actually have to vote, it just means you have to attend the polling booth on election day. As Eric Walk (17) mentioned many citizens have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure that you have that privilege, is it too much to ask that those enjoying the benefits of that sacrifice show their respect on election day by participating in what is and has been fought and died for, regardless of your level of formal education. Would Professor Brennan suggest that those in the armed services are also of a similar level of intelligence? Or is it alright that those who belong to the lowest socioeconomic group in the US continue to do the lion's share of the fighting and dying for his right to vote as has been the case since the Vietnam War.",voting,1
"To legalize doping/medical alterations is, in a way, forcing all athletes to partake. If, as an athlete, I don't want to take drugs or genetically mutate my body to improve performance, I may as well not even show up. The assumption is made that if it is allowed everyone will participate...which is not necessarily the case. Not to mention that by allowing corporate sponsorship, we create an uneven playing field with the rich vs. poor countries.

"The problem is that economic expertise is primarily used by politicians in only convenient, self-serving ways. As someone who majored in economics as an undergraduate at a top liberal arts college, I have found that I can easily discern principled use of economic science from self-serving use. I can also say that over the last 20 years, the impact of macro-economic policy, both fiscal and monetary, has NEVER surprised me. It's also clear to me that many things in this world are primarily driven by things outside the realm of economics. It saddens me that so many professional economists are willing to rent out their professional reputation so cheaply, and to debase the profession so casually. I can't blame the public for dismissing economists generally, but I can lament that the ability to make the world a better place is so casually and needlessly wasted by political opportunists.",economists,0

"Prof. Cohen is absolutely right. Economic theory has trumped economic reality for many generations. I would add that economists do not only fail to account for irrational passions--those ""animal spirits"" that Keynes described--but for the weight of history upon those passions. For instance, economists are mystified that personal savings rate remain so high, even six years into this supposed recovery. This is not a mystery: people remember history. Sixty-five months ago, their investments evaporated. Edmund Burke--yes that Edmund Burke--realized this 225 years ago when he claimed that ""the age of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded."" What they had succeeded in overcoming was, in part, peoples' sense of history.",economists,0

I like it the way it is now. Just like Social Security it was not meant for all. The system doesn't have the resources to expand it's coverage. The reason we have Medicare is to care of the elderly People pay into the system for the benefits the government will give them in the future. It won't be able to do that if the number of people getting benefits isn't fewer than the people who pay into the system. This is how some get more benefits than they put in. It's because some will get nothing. That is why it won't work if you make this benefit available to others.,medicare,1

For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico. I don;t suppose defending that border will be as costly as NATO has been. It should leave funds left over for fixing our many neglected internal problems,nato,0

"Blue collar jobs: My plumber and electrician are both smart guys and seem to do well financially. My hairdresser has somehow amassed enough money to buy and sell large pieces of real estate. I know a young man who makes plenty in his window-washing business, and another friend, who works on computers with a technical-school education, has a house bigger than mine (I have a PhD). A couple of decades ago, we had an addition built on our house, and we used a highly recommended contractor. He told us that, when he graduated from high school, he took the money his father had saved for his college and started a business instead. He is still in business, probably has not had time for college. He has been successful and does good work. I would never minimize the importance of college for those who have a reason to go, but I can't agree with the one-size-fits-all philosophy.

"Mr. Adams, in the absence of regulations, there would be no financial fallout. As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout.

Beyond that, when, in many elections, less than 20% of the registered voters bother to show up in the first place, it would seem that we as voters suppress ourselves far more effectively than any voter ID laws.",free photo ids,1

"It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students. Schools are places of employment for teachers to educate students. Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed. With unemployment still high, and the number of students graduating college increasing, I see no logical reason that it will make staffing schools any harder than it already has been. Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments. The same protections that protect other workers will protect teachers. They really don't need special treatment just because it might hurt morale. Let the experiment run its course.

I am appalled at the apologia for obesity expressed here. The idea that people who eat themselves into poor health should be some sort of protected class of Americans blows my mind. Government should only be used to protect people who are suffering through no fault of their own, not as a crutch for people who have abandoned any sense of personal responsibility. I hope liberals and progressives can wake up and realize that when you pass laws that protect such irresponsibility, you undermine any effort to restrain the real villains, like the corporate crooks that control America.",legislation,0

Perhaps I'm wrong but I know of no such instance even during the most divisive period of American life, the Civil War.

Nor did Marshall rip into Jefferson though he despised him and said so many times -- privately, that is. What Ginsburg did was disgraceful. I despise Trump and view his election as a potential disaster. But Justices like serving members of the military should remain silent and not enter the political fray. Would those who support Ginsburg's public comments about Trump also support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff coming out in favor of his election? I strongly doubt it.

"I would assume that the only group opposed to our leaving NATO are those element of the military industrial complex that profit financially from our continued participation. Beyond the savings in dollars, there are two significant advantages in doing so. First, it would trend against the reality of empires falling as a result of overextending themselves militarily, and second, it would go a long way toward bringing Russia back into the community of European nations, ending a major source of Russian paranoia. Unfortunately, this move makes so much sense that it is unlikely the present congress would entertain it.",nato,0

"Whoever sees room for debate here is just shoveling sand into the growing tide of public revulsion against doping in sports. And the public is right. When the doors open to performance enhancement drugs, they close for the person who does not wish to take drugs in order to compete. I'm not sure exactly who benefits from that outcome, but it's definitely not your kid swinging at softballs in the backyard this summer. Why call it sport if it's to become just a contest to see who can round up the best set of drugs plus the most short-term-minded, health-reckless contestants, coaches, doctors and parents? There was a time when sports competition was about sport. Against great odds today, it still is that for some competitors. They give their best effort and accept either defeat or triumph as just a part of every game, not its only measure. Those competitors are worthy of being our kids' sports hereoes. Who are they now? It's sad that we have to wonder. It's even sadder to contemplate a sports world in which all the winners are on drugs.",doping,0

"Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus. Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day.",fraternities and sororities,0
"There are two major points that bother me about the possibility of players legally doping themselves. The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other). Would games become even more a show of force between the haves and the have nots?",doping,0

Mandatory voting would make matters worse. Most of those not voting are making a wise decision since most are not well informed on the issues. Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now. These media buys are financed by special interest groups whose interests generally do not serve the nation as a whole. The money they spread corrupts the system and is at the root of our current political mess. We need to start with real campaign finance reform that not only restricts how much can be given but also how much can be spent. It requires a constitutional amendment so it will be difficult. It can still happen if the public becomes aware of how bad the situation is and that a real solution is available. This is not a left or right issue. It is one that goes to core values of all Americans.,voting,0

"NATO's decline is irreversible. It serves no European defence needs at all. From time to time it may involve itself in some US Imperial adventure. Or provide cover for some latter day petty European Imperial foray into Africa. There is no Russian threat at all. And no prospect of using NATO as a backstop in the US pivot to confront the inexorable rise of China. Indeed for Europe there is no Chinese threat unless Russia joins a Chinese axis. And in this case NATO is unlikely to be an adequate tool for the brave new world. such an alliance would portend. NATO serves the interests of the US regime and consequently they must bear the financial costs. If the US government doesn't want to pay the bill let it leave. What keeps the US paying is not some positive commitment to democracy,human rights or the American way it is (and quite obviously) fear.

"There were a few times in our history when tuition was waved. After WWII there was the GI Bill. Another was the Russian successful launch of the Sputnik. Both opened university doors to millions of students. I was one of them. With that assistance I made my way into medicine. Others became engineers or researchers. What I know is the nation got a boost of talent, and brought progress to the nation. Mr. Petrilli describes the effect of poverty, and negates the possibility of many to advance themselves and this country. Education even if paid by tax payers does not address every short fall in society, but it does help many. It is time to reject fatalist opinion, and redirect our attention to doing what should be done to improve everyone's survival.",college,1
"Those who ascribe to a mythology-based belief system are well-known through history for the demonizing and murder of everyone else not like them. Christians have 2000 years of experience in the killing of Jews and others, and LGBT folks are only a more recent target because they have been harder to recognize in years past. Organized religions are gigantic hypocrisy machines, pointing to ancient texts to explain how kind they are while running pogroms and burning heretics at the stake most of the time. Our society should step away from the taxpayer-funded support of those whose sacred texts read like comic books with fairies, supermen and flying horses. The Lord Aquaman will be ok with that, since he is all merciful.",christians,0

I see the elimination of foreign language classes as one more sign of the dumbing-down of America. C'est dommage.",humanities programs,1
"""Medicare enrollees would have nothing to fear from insurers charging actuarially fair premiums, because the size of their check would depend on their health status and income, so lower-income and sicker enrollees would get bigger ""Medicare checks"" than healthy and wealthy enrollees..."" Exactly how is this going to be administered? So I start the year healthy and then get sick. Is there a mid-year correction? Would my subsidy go to insurance or directly to pay for care? Who is going to handle the extra layer of paperwork? As for the waste, most enrollees have no control over the wasted spending, and they often have no idea that it's wasteful. For instance, Medicare spends over $300 million on pre-op tests for eye surgery, when research shows those tests don't contribute to positive outcomes. Even when you show a hospital the research they refuse to budge. I've had to fight off unnecessary care many times. I would love for Medicare to make it easier to say no.",medicare,1

"Gaps in European military spending for what threat? Terrorism, by and large, is a law enforcement and intelligence agency problem. It's been used by those who didn't know what to focus on after the end of the cold war as an excuse to continue to play the same old games they were familiar with from the cold war. The USA can no longer afford to p,at the role of world policeman, and Europe - which faces no credible threat of military invasion-can and should provide for its own military needs. The cold war mentality got the USA into too many problems it should never have gotten into - Korea, Vietnam, desert storm, and the two Bush wars. We should disband NATO and while we are at it ask ourselves why are we defending south Korea and Japan? Like Europe these are two rich nations that could defend themselves. Besides the endless waste of money, would anyone reading this think the lives of their son or daughter is worth defending south Korea? It's not 1950 anymore.

In addition, we charge these students 6% to 8% interest!!! Sometimes they have children entering college on credit before they get their student loans paid off. Ridiculous.

Free tuition will only increase college enrollments if we prepare the students for college. The tuition free education is great but we have to start preparing the students early. This way they will strive for the free education. Low income families want the best for their children and this is a way to give the minority students the same chances as other students. I believe that the community colleges are great for students and the funding if made available will allow our students to complete a 2 year degree and more forward with the motivation to get that 4 year degree. We are trying this method with our children in 2016. The federal and state governments must invest in our institutions where the majority of our students are attending.,college,1

"I would offer the experience of my alma mater, Amherst College. When I was at Amherst (Class of 1961), the school was all male and had fraternities (I was a member of Chi Phi). When the college went coed, it required the fraternities to go coed as well. That did not go well at all, and the result was that Amherst abolished all fraternities. A better choice would have been to add sororities to campus life.",fraternities and sororities,1

As an addiction medicine physician I think it would be worthwhile to force treatment on addicts if their use is a danger to self and others. I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done . Just like mandatory seat belts in all US states the same could be argued for mandatory substance abuse treatment,drug addicts,1

"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.",supreme court,0

"It's strange that Christians can read the Bible and not see how many times the concept of ""marriage"" has changed. Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah ""marry"" other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife.

Second, both can be rather unreliable, however, on average the predictions are better than random chance. For example, knowing when when to plant crops and when NOT to plant makes agriculture vastly more effective. If you plant before the river floods or before the last hard frost you're in big trouble. Ancient peoples spent a good bit of money trying to get that right. It was money well spent, even though it wasn't particularly accurate. It was good enough.",economists,1

This fact, hated by progressives, is the key. It never involves everyone with that right taking advantage of it.",conceal carry of firearms,1

"Christian churches long ago strayed from the gospel message of love and mercy and focused on certain sexual acts. Pope Francis recently called the Catholic church on its obsession with abortion, same-sex marriage and birth control. Such obsessions are narrow and negative and tend to miss Christ's main message: to treat persons as persons, not use them as objects. IMHO this means we should be more concerned about one person using or abusing another than about what two consenting adults do to express their love for each other.",christians,0

Medicare is excellent insurance and doesn't need to be changed into a voucher Program. No insurance company wants to sell insurance to a 90 year old man with a 'Coupon'.

"Obese people live difficult lives to be sure, but pointing the finger at genetics or saying they are discriminated against is simply avoiding the ugly truth. They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame? Same for someone who has an addictive personality who turns to illicit drugs or alcohol. In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors. Anyone can lose weight - even lying still in bed. So, the real question isn't about discrimination, it's about leveling the playing field. If you have an addiction, any addiction, you should be treated equally in the workplace.",legislation,1

Everyone knows that teachers are slackers who are too lazy to find real jobs and receive taxpayer money for jobs which they systematically fail to perform. How many teachers actually work before their first classes and after the end of their last classes? The end to all of that, now. It's one thing to complain about real problems with significant effects upon what affects the K-12 educations, it's quite another make up problems which don't. Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation. The performance of students at the end of K-12 corresponds to the affluence and support of education in the community. There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities. Administrators who focus their frustrations upon low performing teachers while fearing to challenge under supporting communities are going to end up just as frustrated as they are today. These districts will get better teachers by tapping a lot more money from taxpayers and not by any other method.",tenure,0

Anyone can who pays the money will have the knowledge and skills injected into their minds, and thus benefit. So why should some be handed it while others pay for it? One must perform considerable work over a prolonged period of time and not everyone has the ability to do it in a reasonable time nor to be able to use it well. But the reason society creates and maintains colleges and universities is that they enable all to benefit from the knowledge and skills those able and willing to gain them do for themselves and everybody else.

"'You must vote,"" I often hear, ""because the next president will pick who sits on the Supreme Court!"" That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. ""living Constitution"", ""originalism"", ""texturalism""; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not ""umpires"", to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are ""umpires"" each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game.",supreme court,1

Tenure keeps those arbitrary firings from happening in the first place, while allowing administrators to fire bad teachers where there's actually a reason to do so.

It could have a marker on it to show if we are citizens, non-citizens here legally, or non-citizens here for only a period of time.

"Citizens should absolutely be able to record police activity if they're not obstructing officers from lawful action, and this right should be explicitly codified. The trouble is, many police officers who either don't understand that right or don't want to be videotaped have a way of halting the taping then coming up with reasons why they were justified in doing so -- claiming obstruction or other bad behavior from the citizen, etc. Then the tape comes back empty and you end up with a he-said she-said mess of what actually happened. The advantage of cameras on officers is that when implemented properly, the tape *can't* come back empty.

That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama. First of all, a society that claims to be free CANNOT force people to vote. It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win! And finally, this is one of the stupidest, most over-reaching, totalitarian ideas since Obamacare mandating that people who do not want to pay for insurance should be forced to get it anyway.

Even if LA's is not currently much used by upper middle class riders, these are not the only people we care about. Moreover, he is badly mistaken when he says that a high-speed rail service ""doesn't touch the huge mass of traffic, which swirls daily in the Los Angeles and San Francisco metropolitan areas."" Intercity rail and local transit are mutually supportive. Predictably, if high speed trains arrive in downtown LA, more people will use the red, gold and other rail lines to reach their trains than currently do to get to LAX. On the contrary, shifting intercity travel preferences has great potential, especially over time, to shift local travel preferences. Without knowing the author's work, I would further point out that Stanford's record on the study of high speed rail is weak, and that Stanford's professors have been numerous (if short-sighted) in protesting a high-speed rail service that they - probably mistakenly - see as negatively impacting their quality of life.

The christianity I'm familiar with (aside from progressive catholic school) and have deep experience with is overwhelmingly anti-gay.

She said she knows what the bible says and so she can judge. Complete hatred from (evangelical fundamentalist) christians toward gays is mainly what I know. I have no doubt several of my relatives were wondering why more gays weren't killed in Orlando as I've heard those comments before. They're not keen on non-christian's either.

The author is concerned about maintaining the judiciary's ""umpire"" role, but the legitimacy of our government is being jeopardized.

Her frank acknowledgment of her own mortality and that of her fellow Justices is almost a sad metaphor for the rule of law in this country should Trump come to power (i.e., its days are numbered). Giving Trump the power to appoint even 1 Justice would, in the ""best"" case scenario, reignite the GOP's shameless attempts to undermine every right that doesn't involve a church, a gun or a corporation. Now consider that he might be empowered to appoint 2 (3?) during his time in office. What good would Ginsburg's silence have been while she watches generations of jurisprudence perverted by a smirking fascist? Is she to console herself with the thought that ""well, it wasn't my place to say""? If she is technically allowed to speak up, we should thanks our stars that she is inclined to do so.",elections,0

"I believe too much emphasis is being place on voter turnout, and not enough emphasis is being placed on education. Is a low unemployment rate a good thing? Yes. Is a high rate of education a good thing? Yes. Is a high voter turnout a good thing? Well, quite frankly that depends. Why is it high? Is it high because concerned, informed citizens are making their voices heard? Not if you move the needle by making it mandatory. You see, voter turnout isn't the answer, it's an indicator. It simply tells you what question you need to ask next. Because what we want is not a high voter turnout. What we want is a large majority of Americans making their opinions heard. While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus. If we succeed in better educating the American people, voter turnout should naturally go up, providing a good indicator of how well we are doing.",voting,1
"I'm a native New Yorker who, in years past, never would have biked in the city because of fear for my safety. However, because of the new bike lanes, I now feel safe enough to bike around my neighborhood in Brooklyn. This summer, I bought a bike for the first time. Yesterday -- December 21 -- I biked 13 miles to visit my parents in Manhattan, riding 75% of the way on bike lanes. The assertions that (a) the bike lanes don't help move people from cars and public transit to bikes, (b) bikers stop using the lanes in the colder months, and (c) bikers prefer non-bike-laned streets are all false in my case.

"I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for).

"More regulation and government intervention rather than less is definitely the answer. Any privatization, block grant or cash payment scheme will directly result in tens of millions of seniors well beyond working age becoming unable to afford medical care. It would strip the security of medical coverage from the most vulnerable among us, the aged. It will also burden their children with additional costs, born of of guilt. This will all result in nothing less than economic stagnation spanning generations. This country's wealthiest individuals are by far the richest and least taxed in our two hundred year history. These plutocrats who have enriched themselves on the backs of working men and women can afford to pay in more and take out less. America's economic security and social justice both equally depend on it.",medicare,1

Justices have free speech but it not part of their job to say political views when their primary job is to enforce the law as it is written or nullify a law which in its time may have been just but it is not now. THATS IT!

"Dr. DuPont and the three other debaters conveniently overlook an important part of the current epidemic of prescription opioid abuse: we really know very little about it. As a physician who specializes in pain management I can tell you that we don't know how many people who are abusing and becoming addicted to these drugs obtained them illicitly, how many lied to physicians to obtain them, and how many received them for legitimate pain complaints. If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential. Do any of the debaters recommend forcing these patients into treatment for this problem?

"Herein lies the rub ...""Many require remedial courses to catch up to college-level work."" What are we doing wrong in K-12 to prepare students for the rigors of college? Heck, my daughter has well above a 4.0 and has scored high on PSAT, etc and I still worry about the rigors of college. We need to set up all students for success. If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life. It's also not the only way. Yes, there are plenty of students attending college on their parents' dime who don't make it and while that wouldn't fly with me, it's their money, not mine. I feel differently about it when taxpayers are funding it.",college,1

In the absence of job protection, it is very easy to imagine states and districts where a teacher would be fired for teaching evolution, for not teaching creationism, for political activities outside of school, for putting Huckleberry Finn on the syllabus, etc. As for the judge's statement that it takes a decade and hundreds of thousands of dollars to fire a bad teacher, that may be because of a particularly onerous set of state laws in California, but that alone doesn't make tenure as a general principle wrong.

A foolish assumption ignoring decades of reality. Turning Medicare into a voucher program and letting people ""shop"" puts all the financial burden onto the backs of people who can least afford it. Healthcare costs will continue to rise until a ""pay for quality and results"" model gets fully implemented. Without that these vouchers will never be allowed to grow in value equal to the healthcare inflation rate. So they will become less valuable and the poor and seniors will suffer. In an ACA-type model, or better yet, a single payer model, implemented with a solid ""pay for performance"" component, the government shoulders the burden of increasing healthcare costs, not the poorest and most vulnerable, and the government takes the responsibility of driving pricing reform because individual consumers cannot do this.",medicare,0

Trump exploits their ignorance, and thus their fears, masterfully. ""I have the answers, and its their fault, not yours (always someone else).

"I agree with Dr. Bauerlein. I am but one case study of what is probably a larger trend. I graduated with my B. S. in Computer Information Systems. But what I was really enthused about was literature and writing. So I took two years off from work to go into a Masters program in English. My enthusiasm turned to repugnance when I realized that succeeding in the humanities was more about politics and high theory than a passion and a dedication to teach literature. Now I am back to working in information technology. Universities were once the gateways to information and learning. With the internet and our vast open information resources, we no longer have to pay outrageous tuition costs in order to get access to those resources and commentary on those resources. The best thing that my two years off gave me was the time to read the great works of Western culture. Unless things change in the humanities departments, I will advise my children to pursue their study of the humanities in their leisure hours. As I found out, when you make a profession out of the humanities, it leads to crass careerism and outlandish theory.",humanities programs,2

"I believe that the right to vote is sufficiently enumerated without having to go through the amendment process. Instead of another amendment, we need elected officials who take seriously their obligation to support and defend the Constitution against all enemies - including those who would disenfranchise millions of American citizens. We need judges who clearly understand that a requirement to present one's driver's license at the polls violates the 24th amendment, as the driver's license fee is a tax. We need to rise up against efforts to disenfranchise college students through various technicalities in residency requirements as violations of the equal protection clause. Here in North Carolina, the NAACP, led by Rev. William Barber, rose up against the draconian voter suppression laws in the Moral Monday movement that swept our state.

The artificialities of recording and broadcast media get in the way, and the rush to the bottom in recorded quality to eliminate dynamic range proves that being able to hear any music on demand has reduced it to background, serving only to cover up the increasing noise of the world and paint over the isolation of the Information Age.

"So often organized religion is morally bankrupt, trailing the enlightenment of the secular. When it was slavery, all the major protestant denominations split at the Mason Dixon line, with half embracing the cause of slavery. After the civil war they all embraced Jim Crow segregation. They finally come around long after everyone with a real conscience has. History now repeats itself on the LGBT issue. Gays and lesbians finally decided they had had enough and courageously proclaimed their right to be who they were, and most of the rest of us, when confronted with this obvious moral imperative, have recognized this societal wrong for what it was, equivalent to racism. Whose left? conservative religions (Islam included). They claim the higher moral ground but are always the last to see their own sin. I have no doubt that in the next twenty years or so, when it will no longer be possible to claim any moral standing or viability, they will, finally, also come around, The last, trailing indicator of a moral evolution, like always.

Thus many of us are trying to live more sustainable lives, which often means turning our backs on suburbia, car culture and over-consumption. Choosing biking, car sharing companies like ZipCar, and living downtown means not only helping the climate and environment but spending less money on a car, which is one of the worst investments a young person can make because of depreciation and expensive car loans. In another part of today's Times, there's an article about predatory lending in the used car loan industry.

"""Barring a drastic improvement in efficiency, tuition-free colleges won't have the resources to serve additional students without compromising the quality of their offerings."" Improvement in efficiency is key here. Certification provides jobs, and social improvement provides purpose. They are different, society benefits when people are working in a rapidly changing job culture. The individual benefits from better communication, cultural growth and personal recognition. Society has an obligation to pay for its own growth - certification for work. ""Despite free tuition, just one-third of students from the bottom income quartile who started at a community college in 2003 finished a degree or certificate by 2009."" What on earth is a bottom income quartile student? These are people who need doable steps. If this interferes with the ability to obtain a self-supporting job, society pays.

He often informed the class that his door was always open and to please stop by for any questions or concerns. He was caring, helpful, and respectful of all students in the class.""

Having worked in the Midwest for the past 5 years amidst a predominantly millennial workforce, I (a now retired baby boomer from New England) was shocked over how many were getting married, having multiple children and committing themselves to a conservative/traditional career path before they reached 30. I particularly noticed that the workforce crowd in the large high rise downtown office buildings in Minneapolis were of the same general age for the most part. There were vey few folks with gray hair such as myself. Perhaps this is just the way the Midwest has always been, but I found it surprising, and a bit disheartening that these folks were already middle aged in my eyes, having committed themselves to a sentence of 30 plus years in office space drudgery without testing the waters of their youth.",young people,2
"""From beginning to end, I believe the Bible is the infallible word of God and I accept it in whole, not in part. As such, I believe the Bible is clear that homosexuality is a sin."" Is it clear? The ancient Israelites inherited a law that homosexual acts (particularly outside of a straight marriage) were sinful, but the rest of the Bible is silent on gay and lesbian people in committed relationships, or possibly it even hints at approval in the story of David and Jonathan. Anti-gay theology is a clear case of the very slicing and dicing that ultra-conservatives claim to abhor. Anyway, a people who accepted the whole Bible would have a lot of child-murder to do. Clearly even ultra-conservative Christians don't take the ancient laws at face value. If they did, then they might be allowed to claim religious liberty as an excuse to preach that gays exist outside of God's plan for humanity. But because they don't, and because the whole Bible is not clear on the subject, this boils down to a belief held by a group of people.

"This write up is enlightening and sensible, dispeling some popular misconception about the breath taking 3D printing technological revolution. Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined. There can little argument that every industry must be fast, flexible and capable to understand the implications that 3D printing will have on their businesses. Failure will mean disaster.

Sixty-five months ago, their investments evaporated.

For my generation NATO was mainly about defending Western Europe against the feared encroachment of the then Soviet Union. Following the second world war Germany was weak and divided. NATO's real mission ended with the reunification of Germany and the collapse of the Soviet Union. Since those events NATO has been an organization in search of a purpose. It keeps getting dragged in to questionable areas like Afghanistan and middle eastern civil wars such as happened in Libya. The USA should move to withdraw its military and its money from Europe at the earliest opportunity. Where else to station troops? probably on our border with Mexico. I don;t suppose defending that border will be as costly as NATO has been. It should leave funds left over for fixing our many neglected internal problems,nato,2

"It's perhaps not surprising that those advocating the dissolution of humanities programs adopt a vocational view of the utility of language education. According to this view, the sole point of learning a foreign language is to be able to conduct business dealings in that language. If there is no need for French in the workplace, there is no need for French in the college curriculum. This attitude of course misses innumerable advantages of learning a foreign language, and shokcinlgy enough, even a dead language like Latin. Reading directly in another language without the filter of translation, engaging with another culture and another mode of seeing and thinking about the world, and learning how to express oneself in another tongue - all of these things have no meaning to the utilitarians and the philistines. I suppose if everyone else just spoke English we could dispense with all this nonsense about foreign languages. And by the way, it's not just French that's being extirpated at SUNY Albany - it's Italian, Russian, classics and theater, too. But that's ok, none of that has anything to do with conducting business.",colleges,2

As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout. They would build diesel cars that maximized their profit and that imposed tremendous costs on everyone else. There would be no incentive whatsoever for them to do anything else.",auto regulations,2

"It is hard for me to sympathize with an article written about teachers, not students. Schools are places of employment for teachers to educate students. Perhaps the reason that there is no evidence, as you say, is because tenure free schools have not existed. With unemployment still high, and the number of students graduating college increasing, I see no logical reason that it will make staffing schools any harder than it already has been. Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments. The same protections that protect other workers will protect teachers. They really don't need special treatment just because it might hurt morale. Let the experiment run its course. If it doesn't work, then we will course correct.",tenure,2

She made a conscious choice to attend, and it is worth saying that at the time she matriculated at Wellesley, other schools did admit women - Penn, Cornell, Brown, Stanford, Berkeley, Michigan, University of Chicago, just to name a few. ""There is no data to support the myth that ... graduates [of single-sex colleges] are more likely to choose math-intensive career options."" Where are the non-data that support this assertion? I was under the impression that the students at women's colleges major in STEM fields at rates markedly higher than women on coed campuses.

I am appalled at the apologia for obesity expressed here. The idea that people who eat themselves into poor health should be some sort of protected class of Americans blows my mind. Government should only be used to protect people who are suffering through no fault of their own, not as a crutch for people who have abandoned any sense of personal responsibility.

"Has a Supreme Court Justice in the entire history of the United States ever publicly criticized a presidential candidate? Perhaps I'm wrong but I know of no such instance even during the most divisive period of American life, the Civil War. Justice Taney, for example, never publicly took Lincoln to task, though Lincoln often eviscerated his Dred Scott decision. Nor did Marshall rip into Jefferson though he despised him and said so many times -- privately, that is. What Ginsburg did was disgraceful. I despise Trump and view his election as a potential disaster. But Justices like serving members of the military should remain silent and not enter the political fray. Would those who support Ginsburg's public comments about Trump also support the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff coming out in favor of his election? I strongly doubt it. Indeed, they would probably demand his scalp and they would be right to do so.",ginsburg,2

"Perhaps rather than forcing greek societies - private organizations controlled individually by charters mandating single-sex admittance - to change their policies, perhaps universities could instead change rules that force fraternities to be the center of social life on campus. Allowing sororities to host parties, for instance, would put women in charge of the distribution of alcohol, which in turn could help to curtail instances of alcohol-related sexual assault. Campuses forcing greek life to go co-ed will lead only to the national chapters of these organizations to suspend their charters at the school. These organizations will, and in my experience have, continue to operate as an underground organization, rather than actually disband; this would only exacerbate the problem, as a secret frat or sorority can be controlled even less than one that operates in the light of day.",fraternities and sororities,2

Forcing them to vote would mean that commercial advertisements would influence elections even more than they do now.

For instance, Medicare spends over $300 million on pre-op tests for eye surgery, when research shows those tests don't contribute to positive outcomes. Even when you show a hospital the research they refuse to budge. I've had to fight off unnecessary care many times. I would love for Medicare to make it easier to say no.",medicare,2

I have worked all over the country and one state that allows this already is South Carolina. I can sign papers as a doctor and mandate treatment. Treatment for substance abuse is effective if it's voluntary and also if its involuntary. Sometimes patients left to make their own decision will not make the right one and will not do on their own so it's a way of getting the thousands of people who really need treatment to treatment. In most cases it's not a moral hazard for a hospital . Hospitals may file papers for force substance abuse treatment but quite often the individual would go to another facility elsewhere. Because there is an drug epidemic and that opiate overdose is the leading cause of death over motor vehicle accidents in young people in this country something must be done .

"There has to be a forum in which a final decision is made when the legislative and executive branches cannot agree, or where laws passed by the states or federal government run contrary to the Bill of Rights and the Constitution and/or current norms (such as gay marriage). Hence, the Supreme Court. Complain all you want, it's a system that has worked pretty well. The notable recent failures were the appointment of GW Bush as President and recent and repeated failures of civil rights for African Americans. Our alternative might be a monarchy, gridlock beyond what we already have, or governments that fail and fall repeatedly as in Italy or Greece or (fill in name here).",supreme court,2
"I share these concerns but I believe that the problem lies in a misalignment of the 9 justices with the body politic, and that this is the result of 30- and 40-year tenures of modern justices. The solution is term limits for justices. Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation. This arrangement would preserve judicial independence while knocking individual justices off the thrones they currently occupy.",justice term limits,2

There are legal protections and remedies that all employees have against prejudicial firing.

The minute number of teachers actually fired for cause speaks for itself. Additionally the argument that reducing tenure will hurt morale might be true for the bad teachers who jobs are at risk.

"It's strange that Christians can read the Bible and not see how many times the concept of ""marriage"" has changed. Abraham repeatedly had his wife Sarah ""marry"" other men in order to obtain advantages over those men (so much for prohibitions against committing adultery). Jacob, aka Israel, had two wives simultaneously and king Solomon had 700, but by New Testament times a man was only allowed one wife. Mosaic law allowed men to obtain divorces from their wives and remarry, but Jesus (who supposedly did not change one ""jot or tittle"" of the law) said that this was adultery in most cases. Clearly ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" in relationships within the Bible itself was changeable. It seems an odd thing to hold ""the meaning of sex and marriage within the cosmic order"" to be fixed and unalterable now when it was not so in the past, and it is needlessly cruel to use this concept as a means of hurting loving, committed same-sex couples.",gay marriage,2

"Some have questioned whether a gun-carrying woman with a gun pressed against her head would have prevailed had she drawn her weapon. We don't know, but it seems doubtful. Many college students love parties, binge drinking and the problems (including anger, fights and sexual abuse) created by those situations. College students also face emotional problems that do or can lead to suicide, and a gun is the easy exit choice -- as it was many years ago when a college freshman friend of mine took his life. Troubled high school and college students are frequently in the news for causing mayhem and carnage on campus. Generally those so inclinded use surprise as a strategy. We don't know the outcomes if other students and teachers packed weapons. Speculation is easy. What outcome if the law required every person over 17 to carry a loaded weapon? Do we really want to find out? At a controversial football game, would someone kill the umpire? Doug Giebel Big Sandy, Montana",gun,2
"The right to vote is already protected in many ways. That said, it is also one of the greatest privileges offered to the American people, and the idea that a privilege should not require some effort to take advantage of has wrongly become embedded in too much commentary in this country. We have freedom of speech, legally protected, but with political correctness rampant in our universities and communities, and people (often from the same disadvantaged groups complaining about voting rights) demonstrating and shouting down any opinions but theirs, I have to say that protection of folks relative to laws is a meaningless protection at best. Indeed, if those folks worried about voting rights took as much time voting and making sure they can as they did demonstrating about it, there would not be a problem with peoples ability to vote at all. And don't even get me started on government overreach at being big brother that makes us afraid to say anything in public, out loud, or online. So much for free speech!

People also used to have as many kids as they could because so many died in childhood, modern medicine has put an end to the need for that.

"Obese people live difficult lives to be sure, but pointing the finger at genetics or saying they are discriminated against is simply avoiding the ugly truth. They are addicts - plain and simple. Obesity is no more a disability than someone with a drug problem. You say genetics are to blame? Same for someone who has an addictive personality who turns to illicit drugs or alcohol. In the end, they may not be personally to blame, in full, but when it comes to drugs, you can fire the abuser instantly without repercussions. Obese people are of the same ilk, except that their drug of choice is food. All the nonsense about slowed metabolisms due to defective thyroids is nothing more than smoke in mirrors. Anyone can lose weight - even lying still in bed. So, the real question isn't about discrimination, it's about leveling the playing field.

Little did they know that over the course of 10 years - 1935-45, that their Jewish heritage would condemn them and their families, including children to genocide orchestrated by the man they thought would not be able to sway the German people to succeed as Chancellor of Germany. They were wrong. I think Justice Ginsburg has more historic perspective than we care to admit. I don't think, as others have confirmed, that being a Judge precludes one from abdicating one's right to vote and free speech on the candidates that stand for election. Further, if Justice Ginsburg is involved in a case that may present a conflict she would be expected to recuse herself.

If some business guy in LA is telling me that this band is so good that it cost $200 to hear them play, or that this band is the next best thing to rocket to number one, it ain't rock and roll.

"Making teachers more vulnerable to termination is bound to cause them to begin to actually try to teach. Everyone knows that teachers are slackers who are too lazy to find real jobs and receive taxpayer money for jobs which they systematically fail to perform. How many teachers actually work before their first classes and after the end of their last classes? The end to all of that, now. It's one thing to complain about real problems with significant effects upon what affects the K-12 educations, it's quite another make up problems which don't. Tenure can be adjusted to require some greater experience and qualifications but eliminating it just makes teaching a far less desirable occupation. The performance of students at the end of K-12 corresponds to the affluence and support of education in the community. There are better teachers in such communities because they are supported much better in those communities. Administrators who focus their frustrations upon low performing teachers while fearing to challenge under supporting communities are going to end up just as frustrated as they are today. These districts will get better teachers by tapping a lot more money from taxpayers and not by any other method.",tenure,2

The study of French is the doorway to understanding our own background (some 40% of English derives from French), our history, our identity. Cutting such vital elements of education is in fact suicidal for U.S. society.",humanities programs,2
"I am a physics professor at a liber I was tenured as a physics professor at a private liberal arts university about 30 years ago. Over the course of the last 15 years, new hires in physics ( and mathematics too) have been in applied, multidisciplinary fields. Unfortunately, the intellectual challenges presented to research workers in most of these areas are rather minimal. Often current applied research is based on well-understood topics in pure physics and mathematics. It's dull research for minimally-trained scientists. The main benefit to such applied fields is that the intellectual distance between the faculty and the students is narrowing. The other benefit is in grants, contracts, and patents that the military-industrial-pharmaceutical complex makes possible. Thus the faculty now trains little cogs for the benefit of the Empire. The loss of French departments and other humanities departments is just part of the reorganized modern university, which is an instrument of the modern nation state to attain greater wealth and power for some and a stultifying life for most. Where does this madness end?",humanity,2

"'You must vote,"" I often hear, ""because the next president will pick who sits on the Supreme Court!"" That such a statement should even be made tells us that something has gone seriously wrong with our democracy.' Correct -- there is something wrong. Among the wrongs is that many of the Constitution's provisions are general ones, thereby allowing multiple interpretations (e.g. ""living Constitution"", ""originalism"", ""texturalism""; conservative, liberal). This leads to Supreme Court Justices commonly being picked politically on the basis of the category (or their perceived politics) to which they presumably belong. Justices are not ""umpires"", to use Robert's word, in the sense of baseball where rules are clear and broadly followed. Rather, they are ""umpires"" each of whom follows their own set of rules and who are picked to do so. It's worth considering that doing similarly in baseball would destroy the game.",supreme court,2

Back in reality, tenure is basically a rule that allows the firing of bad teachers while prohibiting the firing of good ones. Like any rule implemented by human beings, it can be derailed by incompetent supervisors, but the rule itself doesn't protect bad teachers. It protects good ones. Ending tenure doesn't make it any easier for a competent administrator to fire a bad teacher, but it DOES make it easier for an incompetent administrator to fire a GOOD teacher.

It is about a segment of radical Christian fundamentalists that are vigorous in promoting a worldview that is based on a literal reading of some sentences in the Old Testament and are resistant to accepting cultural change and living in a secular society. I am understanding of their dismay and anger - after all, America has become a society where individualism, commercialism, materialism and transnational capitalism have triumphed over community, charity, spirituality and democratic socialism. They feel that they are under attack, just as men did when women received the vote and as whites did in the 1960s who had to live with the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights act, which empowered minorities. Radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Muslim population, just a radical Muslim fundamentalists form a very small proportion of the world's entire Christian population.

"I would be in favor of the following. At least one of the two chambers (presumably the Senate) should ONLY have voters who have graduated from college. Right now, we talk about everyone voting, as if it was some kind of religious ritual like the Sabbath or Ramadhan. But voting is not a religious ritual, it is participation in government making. And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates. We complain that they are appealing to ignorant voters, and at the same time we insist that more of the ignorant vote. This is foolish.

Seems to me that national security demands the study of foreign languages. Or shall we not bother gathering information on the Russians? How many nations in the world speak French? How many are in Asia and Africa, where business opportunities abound, as do the national security concerns Just travel to these nations to learn?

Legally, it's not so clear because our Constitution guarantees freedom of religion while our statutes and the common law set some limits upon how individuals can treat their children when the outcomes imperil their lives and welfare. As a result even if the parents opt out of health care insurance because they do not seek any health care, if they or their children need emergency care it will be provided unless they can legally refuse treatment -- meaning that the children will likely receive health care when the conditions are serious enough regardless of the parents wishes.",religion,2
"Wrong, America does not have serious voter turnout problems. Democrats have serious voter turnout problems. Of course they would support mandating that people ignorant of the issues vote. That's their voting base. And the entire reason for the election and re-election of President Obama. First of all, a society that claims to be free CANNOT force people to vote. It irrevocably ceases to be free as soon as you require people to do things they don't have any interest in doing. Second, forced participation for the sake of participation is an idea that could only originate with and be supported by a group of politicians who know that preying on the poor, ignorant, and easily manipulated is their best chance to hold onto power forever. Simply force them to vote and then lie constantly to demonize the opposition, and you ALWAYS win! And finally, this is one of the stupidest, most over-reaching, totalitarian ideas since Obamacare mandating that people who do not want to pay for insurance should be forced to get it anyway.

Why in the world should he be required by law to incur higher medical bills and lost days at work because I decide to stuff my face with pizza or ice cream? It makes no sense any more than it makes sense for people be required by law to pay the health costs for people who acquire a disease because of their voluntary participation in unprotected sex activities or ride motorcycles without helmets or smoke cigarettes. An illness or incapacity acquired like my obesity should not be thrust upon those who are struggling to make ends meet.",refusal to hire because of weight,2

Also, only the wealthy pay the 'rack rate' full tuition at the top institutions with decent endowments or state funding. Free tuition would increase two things: more marginally or unqualified applicants and proliferation of easy, feel good, study yourself courses and majors. The idea of substituting community service for standardized test scores and grades as a basis for admission will further dilute the seriousness of university scholarship.

While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus.

When people think they're just fine, but they're beating up their elderly parents (who won't press charges, believing that home is the safest place for their wayward offspring), then they need to be forcibly removed and treated. They may have severe emotional problems, but they're still a menace.

By continuing a endless civil war and emptying out the country of Syria, forcing migration to Europe (since most people apparently prefer the personal liberty available in democratic societies, as opposed to either poor and/or authoritarian countries like Russia & China), Russia can create a continuing burden of crisis proportions, and a distraction from the world's ability to coordinate a response to counter Russian expansionism in Crimea, Syria, the middle east, the arctic, and elsewhere.

"I live about 2 blocks from the University of Utah campus, where concealed carry has been permitted for something like 5 years now, but only for people who meet the usual criteria for such which means only those 21 or over can legally carry. Utah is also a state which is getting used to open carry. I've seen examples of that practice maybe every third month or so. That is also permitted on campus here, but only for concealed carry permit holders. I take walks on that campus and I rarely think about guns being near me because they will be near me pretty much any where I go in Utah. When I go to the 24 hour fitness gym at Trolley Corners about 2 miles away I sometimes do remember the mass shooting that occurred at Trolley Square just across the street about 9 years ago.

"I can't understand why the justification for the study of Humanities is utilitarian in most of the pieces and blogs in this article. Certainly critical thinking skills can be obtained in the social and natural sciences (often to a greater degree than in languages) and ditto for the other general skills it supposedly provides (but not necessarily). The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms. It is a reality, not merely a sign of increasingly philistine times.",humanities programs,2

If we coerce this last group into getting treatment for the substance abuse, who's going to do something about their pain? Also benzodiazepine abuse and addiction is a major problem and we know that these are mostly a result of physicians prescribing these without giving much thought to the abuse potential.

But, with the assigning of research papers, teachers and professors must ensure that they are teaching the proper critical reading and analytical skills with which to evaluate and utilise these resources. Given the extremely complex world in which we live, the ability to reason critically and vigorously couldn't be stressed enough. Assigning essays and the research paper would enable students to work with seeming volumes of sometimes contrasting information, come to a view, defend that view, and reconcile that view with differing ones - that's what we do everyday, and the ability to do it well is necessary to maintain a free-thinking, socially- and environmentally-responsible, democratic society.",research papers,2

If we have to teach them in college what they should have learned in high school then they are not ready for college whether it's paid for or not. I'm all for heavily subsidizing the cost of a college education for students who can't afford it because I'm a believer in the ""all boats rise"" theory and I think equal access to higher education is crucial to changing a person's trajectory in life.
