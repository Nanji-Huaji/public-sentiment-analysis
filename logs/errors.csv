Economic growth requires innovation, enabled through this kind of technologies. Innovation is an integral part of prosperity of an organization which cannot occur without embracing state of the art capabilities. One important capability of 3D printing, is to enable continuous innovations. Yet, as aptly pointed out by the author, traditional manufacturing still holds an important place in the business world. Once products are developed, it is challenging for 3D printers to match the economies of scale available through traditional manufacturing. The main advantage of 3D printing is enabling of low cost rapid prototypes , as compared to traditional manufacturing, which typically requires higher volumes to lower costs. 3D printing will potentially have a greater impact on the world over the next 20 years than all of the innovations from the industrial revolution combined.

355,"Mr. Adams, in the absence of regulations, there would be no financial fallout. As an example, auto emissions impose large costs on society i.e., pollution, and on many individuals in society, for example those with respiratory problems. But car manufacturers do not bear those costs - the costs are externalities to the manufacturer. Markets are in general very good at coordinating supply and demand and allocating capital but markets only work if economic actors both receive the benefits but also bear the costs of their business decisions. Regulations, however imperfect, are necessary because, in many circumstances economic actors receive the profits but do not pay the costs of their activity. In such circumstances it is rational for a firm maximize its profits while ignoring the costs, however large, of its business activities. If there were no emissions regulations, including penalties for violating, those regulations, VW would face no financial fallout.

Teachers should serve the schools boards, and the parents associations, not themselves. The fact that an outspoken teacher may be fired could be a good thing. In higher education, where research is done, tenure certainly has a place. However, to get tenure, takes an awe inspiring mix of academic credentials, politics, and dedication. And it happens without a union. In secondary education, it takes virtually nothing as the teachers union strangles local governments.

The first one is that regardless of the control and vigilance exerted over the use of game enhancing drugs, there will always be secondary effects that will either affect the athlete in the sport or later, at home or over a longer period of time. I don't know if it is ever truly ethical to affect a person's long term health over a short period gain. The second problem I have with this doping issue is the unfair advantage it gives over other players. It is pretty clearly observed in the Olympics that very developed countries (USA, England, Germany, China, etc.) have funds to give a boost and every advantage possible to already talented athletes. It just seems to me that these drugs are something that would be more affordable and easier to monitor where money flows, creating an even bigger gap between economically advantaged players and those with less resources (even if they are physically on par to each other).

Simply YouTube the judge's (played by Burt Lancaster) astounding speech toward the latter part of the film and you will see that he laments NOT having spoken out when he could sense where things were going.

NATO is showing its true purpose at last: maintain the Western imperial hegemony. Turkey is an important an anti-Russian outpost. Who cares if Turkey does not recognize its own Armenian genocide? Who cares if it stole the country that Kurds were supposed to have and then tried to obliterate the Kurdish identity altogether? Who cares if it nurtured the Syrian civil war? Who cares if it suffocates its own democratic institutions as it transitions into Putin-like authoritarianism? We need Turkey to stick to the Russians.

Maybe because it was West Virginia, where mineral wealth had long been exploited by out-of-state corporations. These geology maors, who were preparing themselves with the scientific understanding to deal with mineral managements, were also intellectually engaged in a most vivid way with their classics and philosophy classes.

And those who do not read newspapers and do not understand the issues, should preferably not vote. I know my point of view is unusual, in a society where voting is regarded as a kind of party - the more the better. But perhaps this is an area where skill matters. If most voters had graduated from college, I doubt that we would see Cain or Perry as viable candidates.

The point is that Humanities constitutes windows to many areas of human thinking and accomplishment in the past and present--and that in itself is sufficient justification. The arguments put forth by Humanists in this piece are not very compelling (if that is a sign of the skills the discipline trains them for). Include some scientists in the debate to make it interdisciplinary. An important issue that has determined the desperate thinking of parents and students is that the cost of university education--even public education--has gone up enormously and the investment cost in education (for families and the state) makes them increasingly think in these narrowly pragmatic terms.

The best American universities recognize that they are graduating multi-dimensional human beings. Nothing could be more destructive of our civilization than to graduate one-dimensional specialists. Today's political campaign, with its capture by extremist reactionaries of gullible voters undereducated for citizenship, demonstrates that we have an acute need for multi-dimensional education throughout our society.

Every president should nominate 1 justice in each of the 1st and 3rd years of his or her term, save only when either a justice has retired or died during that period (and the sitting president has made a nomination) or when the turnover has been so great that no justice has served less than 15 years. The longest serving justice would become a senior justice to make way for a new appointment every two years. This would mean that the composition of the court would never lag politics by more than 5-10 years. It would also mean that the justices would be more cautious about taking radically new directions (like destroying the voting rights act and campaign finance regulation) in view of any majority they assemble to rewrite the law inevitably dissolving in much less than a generation.

While voter turnout is an indicator of that, you don't cure a disease by covering up the symptoms. If educated people tend to vote more, then that should be the focus.

推测胡鑫宇是被犯罪集团绑架控制，始终处于学校或者储粮仓库某隐秘处，当地各路视频未能发现踪迹情况下，犯罪分子若已经转移胡鑫宇则可以在转移后的地点轻松处理，不会冒被发现风险再度回到案发地附近，故胡鑫宇始终就在学校不远处。而这个隐秘地点警犬未发现的或者发现后未上报的原因就在于存在一种力量在阻碍胡的发现，说明如果胡被发现背后的嫌疑人非常容易被挖掘出，综合地点就在附近和遗体发现过程的蹊跷，那么凶手是谁，相关力量如何配合作案，已经不难推断。结论三 高启强不可怕，可怕的是。。。",警方通告胡鑫宇为自杀,AGAINST,NEITHER

1845,浅谈满江红成本 个人觉得成本高低不能决定影片内涵与质量，满江红成本我一个外行人看都知道是低的，但这片子是精彩的，性价比高的。收益高不仅是因为成本低，更与好的剧本、好的演员、好的音效有关。所以成本低不能是满江红被矛头所指的原因，相反我们应该宣扬此类“高性价比”电影，激励该行业的编导们动脑子拍出有文化以及人文价值的东西。有人会觉得那会不会所有人都去拍低成本片了？不会的。术业有专攻，人各有志。有人有兴趣就会去拍高成本高制作片，比如春节同期的流浪地球和深海。作为观众我们需要对中国编导制作人有信心，并给予鼓励和支持。以上是肯定的。接下来说下拍片的问题，我的结论是：不应该垄断。好的电影宁愿延长放映期，而不是抢占排片。让所有的影片公平竞争，根据受欢迎程度适量更改，而不是垄断。希望中国电影百花齐放，薪火相传。,满江红起诉大V,POSITIVE,NEITHER

1866," 一场大戏就这么结束了？这也太搞笑了，而且这个回应啊，属实是有点……就不说什么“造谣者”完全是偏方的主观臆测了，就说底下这段话，简直就是糟糕公关的典型代表！

首先“希望理性观影，不要再掐了”，可是官博当初发的可是“跟我斗，你们还差的远呢……“，这不就是赤果果的挑衅嘛？合着你们可以挑衅别人，别人不能掐你们？

第二，“大V有一定话语权……不当言论会影响片方利益”。可是什么是不当言论呢？是不符合你利益的言论就是不当言论么？谁来界定这个言论当与不当？而且，大V的不当言论可以显示出来，那普通网友的所谓“不当言论”是不是就被某些不可名状的力量弄没了？还有，春节期间，无数大V扯脖子喊，利用个人影响力把网友忽悠进电影院，然后好多人都觉得那些大V吹的有点过，这算不算是“不当言论”呢？

第三，也是最搞笑的一句话：“我们和其他部门和大V沟通过，少部分坚持观点，我们没办法”。这就是赤果果的告诉别人，我们找大V 了，一些我们给钱了，或者“以德服人”了，于是就被“公关”了，另一些大V，给钱人家不要，讲理也讲不过，没招了。

合着你们的电影，说不定，不允许有背面声音，如果有所谓的不符合你们利益的“不当言论”，就想各种办法去解决说话的人呗？这让我想起一句话，解决不了电影问题，就解决提出问题的人。

当然还有好多槽点，就不一一吐槽了。

要我说啊，满江红的片方，赶紧换一批宣发吧，是在不行就换一批真读过书的做题家，亡羊补牢嘛，要不官博发一篇满江红整出10个错别字，所谓的回应也全是漏洞和破绽，要不就真的花大价钱，把你们口中那几个所谓的“造谣”大V雇过来，人家微博帖子那个撰文水平，逻辑的严谨程度，可是完全吊打你们的这些宣发了呢。

1869,"事情发展到现在，《满江红》影片运营方应该要承认，他们有4个地方是做得不太好：1、拿秦桧诬陷岳飞的“莫须有”自证清白；2、官博不知道“靖康”是一个年号；3、岳飞忌日不纪念，连发数条微博，尽和网友扯口舌…4、起诉大V。大v文章我看了，有的是善意劝告，他却把别人告了。有点敌友不分。

前期放一些幕后花絮、记者采访都挺好。像我这种观众，就很喜欢去了解拍摄中的趣事，去发现电影里的细节。

可后面，运营方把自己放在网友的对立面，一本正经地叫冤、指责，还起诉……

就让人感觉玩不起了。毕竟你赚了那么多钱，有人指指点点也正常。

根据我这两年当博主的经验，在微博上，一定要“姿态软”，然后，只关注自己该关注的。

为什么要姿态软？因为互联网是草根文化。你越强硬、越一本正经，越引人反感。姿态软，才容易被人接纳。咱不是经常说“通情达理”吗？情绪到了，理才能达到。

只关注自己该关注的，这点很好理解。因为互联网上声音太多太杂，你都注意，顾不过来。

比如，《满江红》运营方应该关注的是：电影大卖。所以，卖得好，感谢下大家支持。

另外，你是内容创作者，应该多多分析作品，这是你的强项。和和气气，带大家多理解构思，惊叹导演73高龄做到这样的突破，而不是盯着黑粉。

说真的，当你关注黑粉时，你的眼里就只有黑粉，太拉低作品的艺术成就了，也埋没了几千艺术工作者的努力。

韩红的片尾曲多好听，一如既往的温暖大气。片中那些锣鼓一样的音乐，据说都有隐喻。告诉我们吧？

还有，我觉得，黑粉开始并没有那么多。还有很多关注作品本身的观众，要不不会初三开始靠口碑逆袭。

后来黑粉多，一部分是看不惯运营方的“一本正经”。太容易让人联系到古板、生硬、道貌岸然的领导了。

好好解释，疏忽/写错了的地方改正下，把关注点拉回作品本身。

柔软点。和气生财、闷声发大财。

电影本身还是好电影。

1890,泼水节狂欢，别让祝福变了味。近日，云南傣历1385泼水节的视频引发了公众对其是否流氓化的质疑。在有些视频中，有人趁乱扯拽女子衣服，有人涉嫌侵犯他人隐私，引起了人们对泼水节的关注和讨论。对于这样一个富有几千年历史的传统节日，该如何平衡其现代化需求和文化传承呢？泼水节是少数民族的民俗节日，这种打破边界感的狂欢节并不多见。对于当地民众以及参与者来说，对这样一个传统节日是有预期的，也包括心理层面的准备。然而，如何保障人们的安全和活动的和谐性是一个难题。在以往泼水节多用的是盆，但现在多用水枪等攻击性更强的工具。因此，我们必须解决在满足人们现代需求的同时，保持文化传承和庆祝方式的问题。针对泼水节面临的问题，有人说应该合理发展民俗文化，对具有狂欢性质的泼水节，不必上纲上线地大加挞伐，甚至污名化。即不让泼水节祝福变了味，也不要过度规范失去鲜明特色。在未来的泼水节中，有人说可以加强管理，提高文明意识。其实傣族泼水节对国外朋友是很有吸引力的，可以借鉴其他国家的庆典活动，在其基础上，逐步推进泼水节的现代化进程。只有这样，泼水节才能真正成为一个独特的文化品牌，吸引更多民族文化爱好者参与其中。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,POSITIVE,NEITHER
1891,掑撕雨衣这事可大可小，要是没发到网络，或者关注的热度小一点，其实就是一小事，只不过现在热度起来了，那就是一件大事了，甚至连当地官方都不得不出来调查。其实从撕衣男子动作初衷就可以看出，他的本意是想撕掉对方的雨衣，而不是撕对方的衣服，网上很多人把这两个概念混淆，认为撕雨衣就等同于是撕衣服，这是不对的。撕雨衣只是在当时的特定环境及氛围下，做出的一个不理智的行为，如果换个场合，他肯定干不出这事来。而撕衣服则是耍流氓，是违法行为，放在哪都是不被允许的。泼水节本质是一个少数民族的节日，之所以吸引这么多人去当地体验，就是被他们的节日氛围所感染，在这种氛围下很容易让人模糊边界感，见人就泼水，管你认不认得，先泼了再说。此时每个人都释放了天性，行为动作变得格外大胆，在一些事情的尺度上没有把握好，好心办了坏事。就像婚闹一样，即要保证婚礼热闹，让大家感受到结婚的喜庆，又不能闹的太过，让新郎新娘下不来台，所以此时就该多包容，对一些不太出格的行为多多理解，而不是苛刻的指责。,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,POSITIVE,NEITHER

1898,撕雨衣这是人干的事? 这不是性骚扰难道是少数民族的特有祝福? 而且，别以为我们汉族不知道，泼水节指的是拿水盆，从肩膀处浇下去，代表着祝福。 拿水枪呲女性敏感部位，叫尼玛祝福? 你们的妈妈当年也是被一圈男人拿水呲着长大的呗？,泼水节女生选择原谅对方,AGAINST,NEITHER
1899,"你去海边游泳，去泡个温泉，有人披着浴巾，会给扯下来么。专泼好看会透的，为的是什么。更有甚者，拿个泼水枪，专门滋重点部位，这是在祝福，还是耍流氓。这是另一种，得不到的就诋毁。

又想玩水，又不想透，完全可以兼得。却被说成，你为何要来，玩不起就走，别小心眼。但重点是，撕雨衣的行为，根本就是在骚扰。

趁着节日，出门占便宜，趁着人多，趁机摸一把。就是这种害群之马，让人望而却步，不敢尽情享受，只能避而远之，让传统文化蒙羞。

原谅是原谅，犯错是犯错，该警告就要警告。更要加强监管，别让小人有机可乘，这种人多的活动，往往是猥亵重灾区，很多女性都被伤害过。
